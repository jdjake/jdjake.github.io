They appear to tell the truth, to reflect life back out at us; but set a mirror correctly and it will lie so convincingly you’ll believe that something has vanished into thin air, that a box filled with doves and flags and spiders is actually empty, that people hidden in the wings or the pit are floating ghosts upon the stage. Angle it right and a mirror becomes a magic casement; it can show you anything you can imagine and maybe a few things you can’t.</p>

A distorting mirror, to be sure, and a concealing mirror, set at forty-five degrees to reality, but it’s a mirror nonetheless, which we can use to tell ourselves things we might not otherwise see. (Fairy tales, as G. K. Chesterton once said, are more than true. Not because they tell us that dragons exist, but because they tell us that dragons can be defeated.)</p>

Underneath it was a walking stick and a water-stained copy of Romance and Legend of Chivalry by A. R. Hope Moncrieff, priced at five pence. Next to the book, on its side, was the Holy Grail. It had a little round paper sticker on the base, and written on it, in felt pen, was the price: 30p.</p>

              <p class="highlight__text">The next morning was Friday; on alternate Fridays Mrs. Whitaker and Mrs. Greenberg would visit each other. Today it was Mrs. Greenberg’s turn to visit Mrs. Whitaker. They sat in the parlor and ate macaroons and drank tea. Mrs. Whitaker took one sugar in her tea, but Mrs. Greenberg took sweetener, which she always carried in her handbag in a small plastic container.</p>
            
              <p class="highlight__text">“That’s nice,” said Mrs. Greenberg, pointing to the Grail. “What is it?”</p>
            
              <p class="highlight__text">“It’s the Holy Grail,” said Mrs. Whitaker. “It’s the cup that Jesus drunk out of at the Last Supper. Later, at the Crucifixion, it caught His precious blood when the centurion’s spear pierced His side.”</p>
            
              <p class="highlight__text">Mrs. Greenberg sniffed. She was small and Jewish and didn’t hold with unsanitary things. “I wouldn’t know about that,” she said, “but it’s very nice. Our Myron got one just like that when he won the swimming tournament, only it’s got his name on the side.”</p>
            
              <p class="highlight__text">“Is he still with that nice girl? The hairdresser?”</p>
            
              <p class="highlight__text">“Bernice? Oh yes. They’re thinking of getting engaged,” said Mrs. Greenberg.</p>

              <p class="highlight__text">When she got home, Galaad was waiting for her. He was giving the neighborhood children rides on Grizzel’s back, up and down the street.</p>
            
              <p class="highlight__text">“I’m glad you’re here,” she said. “I’ve got some cases that need moving.”</p>
            
              <p class="highlight__text">She showed him up to the boxroom in the top of the house. He moved all the old suitcases for her, so she could get to the cupboard at the back.</p>
            
              <p class="highlight__text">It was very dusty up there.</p>
            
              <p class="highlight__text">She kept him up there most of the afternoon, moving things around while she dusted.</p>
            
              <p class="highlight__text">Galaad had a cut on his cheek, and he held one arm a little stiffly.</p>
            
              <p class="highlight__text">They talked a little while she dusted and tidied. Mrs. Whitaker told him about her late husband, Henry; and how the life insurance had paid the house off; and how she had all these things, but no one really to leave them to, no one but Ronald really and his wife only liked modern things. She told him how she had met Henry during the war, when he was in the ARP and she hadn’t closed the kitchen blackout curtains all the way; and about the sixpenny dances they went to in the town; and how they’d gone to London when the war had ended, and she’d had her first drink of wine.</p>
            
              <p class="highlight__text">Galaad told Mrs. Whitaker about his mother Elaine, who was flighty and no better than she should have been and something of a witch to boot; and his grandfather, King Pelles, who was well-meaning although at best a little vague; and of his youth in the Castle of Bliant on the Joyous Isle; and his father, whom he knew as “Le Chevalier Mal Fet,” who was more or less completely mad, and was in reality Lancelot du Lac, greatest of knights, in disguise and bereft of his wits; and of Galaad’s days as a young squire in Camelot.</p>

              <p class="highlight__text">Mrs. Whitaker picked up the stone, which was heavier than it looked, and held it up to the light. It was milkily translucent, and deep inside it flecks of silver glittered and glinted in the late-afternoon sunlight. It was warm to the touch.</p>
            
              <p class="highlight__text">Then, as she held it, a strange feeling crept over her: Deep inside she felt stillness and a sort of peace. Serenity, that was the word for it; she felt serene.</p>
            
              <p class="highlight__text">Reluctantly she put the stone back on the table.</p>
            
              <p class="highlight__text">“It’s very nice,” she said.</p>
            
              <p class="highlight__text">“That is the Philosopher’s Stone, which our forefather Noah hung in the Ark to give light when there was no light; it can transform base metals into gold; and it has certain other properties,” Galaad told her proudly. “And that isn’t all. There’s more. Here.” From the leather bag he took an egg and handed it to her.</p>
            
              <p class="highlight__text">It was the size of a goose egg and was a shiny black color, mottled with scarlet and white. When Mrs. Whitaker touched it, the hairs on the back of her neck prickled. Her immediate impression was one of incredible heat and freedom. She heard the crackling of distant fires, and for a fraction of a second she seemed to feel herself far above the world, swooping and diving on wings of flame.</p>
            
              <p class="highlight__text">She put the egg down on the table, next to the Philosopher’s Stone.</p>
            
              <p class="highlight__text">“That is the Egg of the Phoenix,” said Galaad. “From far Araby it comes. One day it will hatch out into the Phoenix Bird itself; and when its time comes, the bird will build a nest of flame, lay its egg, and die, to be reborn in flame in a later age of the world.”</p>
            
              <p class="highlight__text">“I thought that was what it was,” said Mrs. Whitaker.</p>
            
              <p class="highlight__text">“And, last of all, lady,” said Galaad, “I have brought you this.”</p>
            
              <p class="highlight__text">He drew it from his pouch, and gave it to her. It was an apple, apparently carved from a single ruby, on an amber stem.</p>
            
              <p class="highlight__text">A little nervously, she picked it up. It was soft to the touch—deceptively so: Her fingers bruised it, and ruby-colored juice from the apple ran down Mrs. Whitaker’s hand.</p>
            
              <p class="highlight__text">The kitchen filled—almost imperceptibly, magically—with the smell of summer fruit, of raspberries and peaches and strawberries and red currants. As if from a great way away she heard distant voices raised in song and far music on the air.</p>
            
              <p class="highlight__text">“It is one of the apples of the Hesperides,” said Galaad, quietly. “One bite from it will heal any illness or wound, no matter how deep; a second bite restores youth and beauty; and a third bite is said to grant eternal life.” Mrs. Whitaker licked the sticky juice from her hand. It tasted like fine wine.</p>
            
              <p class="highlight__text">There was a moment, then, when it all came back to her—how it was to be young: to have a firm, slim body that would do whatever she wanted it to do; to run down a country lane for the simple unladylike joy of running; to have men smile at her just because she was herself and happy about it.</p>
            
              <p class="highlight__text">Mrs. Whitaker looked at Sir Galaad, most comely of all knights, sitting fair and noble in her small kitchen.</p>
            
              <p class="highlight__text">She caught her breath.</p>
            
              <p class="highlight__text">“And that’s all I have brought for you,” said Galaad. “They weren’t easy to get, either.”</p>
            
              <p class="highlight__text">Mrs. Whitaker put the ruby fruit down on her kitchen table. She looked at the Philosopher’s Stone, and the Egg of the Phoenix, and the Apple of Life.</p>
            
              <p class="highlight__text">Then she walked into her parlor and looked at the mantelpiece: at the little china basset hound, and the Holy Grail, and the photograph of her late husband Henry, shirtless, smiling and eating an ice cream in black and white, almost forty years away.</p>
            
              <p class="highlight__text">She went back into the kitchen. The kettle had begun to whistle. She poured a little steaming water into the teapot, swirled it around, and poured it out. Then she added two spoonfuls of tea and one for the pot and poured in the rest of the water. All this she did in silence.</p>
            
              <p class="highlight__text">She turned to Galaad then, and she looked at him.</p>
            
              <p class="highlight__text">“Put that apple away,” she told Galaad, firmly. “You shouldn’t offer things like that to old ladies. It isn’t proper.”</p>

              <p class="highlight__text">The troll sniffed the air, and smiled. “You’re all alone,” he said. “There’s nothing else on the path. Nothing at all.” Then he leaned down, and ran his fingers over me: it felt like butterflies were brushing my face—like the touch of a blind person. Then he snuffled his fingers, and shook his huge head. “You don’t have a big sister. You’ve only a younger sister, and she’s at her friend’s today.”</p>
            
              <p class="highlight__text">“Can you tell all that from smell?” I asked, amazed.</p>

              <p class="highlight__text">Cars passed over the bridge above me; I could hear a radio playing loudly in one of them.</p>
            
              <p class="highlight__text">“Hello?” I said, quietly, feeling embarrassed, feeling foolish.</p>

              <p class="highlight__text">Silence.</p>
            
              <p class="highlight__text">I began to cry then, stupidly, silently, sobbing under the bridge.</p>
            
              <p class="highlight__text">A hand touched my face, and I looked up.</p>
            
              <p class="highlight__text">“I didn’t think you’d come back,” said the troll.</p>
            
              <p class="highlight__text">He was my height now, but otherwise unchanged. His long gonk hair was unkempt and had leaves in it, and his eyes were wide and lonely.</p>
            
              <p class="highlight__text">I shrugged, then wiped my face with the sleeve of my coat. “I came back.”</p>
            
              <p class="highlight__text">Three kids passed above us on the bridge, shouting and running.</p>
            
              <p class="highlight__text">“I’m a troll,” whispered the troll, in a small, scared voice. “Fol rol de ol rol.” He was trembling.</p>
            
              <p class="highlight__text">I held out my hand and took his huge clawed paw in mine. I smiled at him. “It’s okay,” I told him. “Honestly. It’s okay.”</p>
            
              <p class="highlight__text">The troll nodded.</p>
            
              <p class="highlight__text">He pushed me to the ground, onto the leaves and the wrappers and the condom, and lowered himself on top of me. Then he raised his head, and opened his mouth, and ate my life with his strong sharp teeth.</p>
            
              <p class="highlight__text">When he was finished, the troll stood up and brushed himself down. He put his hand into the pocket of his coat and pulled out a bubbly, burnt lump of clinker rock.</p>
            
              <p class="highlight__text">He held it out to me.</p>
            
              <p class="highlight__text">“This is yours,” said the troll.</p>
            
              <p class="highlight__text">I looked at him: wearing my life comfortably, easily, as if he’d been wearing it for years. I took the clinker from his hand, and sniffed it. I could smell the train from which it had fallen, so long ago. I gripped it tightly in my hairy hand.</p>
            
              <p class="highlight__text">“Thank you,” I said.</p>
            
              <p class="highlight__text">“Good luck,” said the troll.</p>
            
              <p class="highlight__text">“Yeah. Well. You too.” The troll grinned with my face.</p>
            
              <p class="highlight__text">It turned its back on me and began to walk back the way I had come, toward the village, back to the empty house I had left that morning; and it whistled as it walked.</p>
            
              <p class="highlight__text">I’ve been here ever since. Hiding. Waiting. Part of the bridge. I watch from the shadows as the people pass: walking their dogs, or talking, or doing the things that people do. Sometimes people pause beneath my bridge, to stand, or piss, or make love. And I watch them, but say nothing; and they never see me.</p>

              <p class="highlight__text">Almost, but not entirely. For each of the children, separately, remembered walking alone in the moon’s blue light, on his or her own bare feet, up to the nursery. It was almost like sleepwalking, feet soundless on the wood of the stairs, on the threadbare nursery carpet. Remembered opening the treasure chest, pawing through the dolls and the clothes and pulling out the box.</p>
            
              <p class="highlight__text">And then the child would touch the catch, and the lid would open, slow as a sunset, and the music would begin to play, and Jack came out. Not with a pop and a bounce: he was no spring-heeled Jack. But deliberately, intently, he would rise from the box and motion to the child to come closer, closer, and smile.</p>
            
              <p class="highlight__text">And there in the moonlight, he told them each things they could never quite remember, things they were never able entirely to forget.</p>
            
              <p class="highlight__text">The oldest boy died in the Great War. The youngest, after their parents died, inherited the house, although it was taken from him when he was found in the cellar one night with cloths and paraffin and matches, trying to burn the great house to the ground. They took him to the madhouse, and perhaps he is there still.</p>
            
              <p class="highlight__text">The other children, who had once been girls and now were women, declined, each and every one, to return to the house in which they had grown up; and the windows of the house were boarded up, and the doors were all locked with huge iron keys, and the sisters visited it as often as they visited their eldest brother’s grave, or the sad thing that had once been their younger brother, which is to say, never.</p>
            
              <p class="highlight__text">Years have passed, and the girls are old women, and owls and bats have made their homes in the old attic nursery, rats build their nests among the forgotten toys. The creatures gaze uncuriously at the faded prints on the wall, and stain the remnants of the carpet with their droppings.</p>
            
              <p class="highlight__text">And deep within the box within the box, Jack waits and smiles, holding his secrets. He is waiting for the children. He can wait forever.</p>

              <p class="highlight__text">In the theater of my dreams, a man with a beard and a baseball cap carried on a movie screen, and then he walked off-stage. The silver screen hung in the air, unsupported.</p>
            
              <p class="highlight__text">A flickery silent film began to play upon it: a woman who came out and stared down at me. It was June Lincoln who flickered on the screen, and it was June Lincoln who walked down from the screen and sat on the edge of my bed.</p>

              <p class="highlight__text">“Why on earth would I do that?” she asked. In my dream she smelled of gin and old celluloid, although I do not remember the last dream I had where anyone smelled of anything. She smiled, a perfect black-and-white smile. “I got out, didn’t I?” Then she stood up and walked around the room.</p>
            
              <p class="highlight__text">“I can’t believe this hotel is still standing,” she said. “I used to fuck here.” Her voice was filled with crackles and hisses. She came back to the bed and stared at me, as a cat stares at a hole.</p>

              <p class="highlight__text">In 2065 she’s stretched out on the revolving floor of a holographic photographer, who records her as an erotic dream in Living Sensolove, imprisons the sight and sound and the very smell of her in a tiny diamond matrix. She’s only nineteen.</p>
            
              <p class="highlight__text">And a caveman outlines Charlotte with a burnt stick on the wall of the temple cave, filling in the shape and the texture of her with earths and berry dyes. Nineteen.</p>

              <p class="highlight__text">I want her so much it makes me hurt sometimes. That’s when I take down the photographs of her and just look at them for a while, wondering why I didn’t try to touch her, why I wouldn’t really even speak to her when she was there, and never coming up with an answer that I could understand.</p>

We think of ourselves as scholars in arcane liturgies, single men trapped in worlds beyond our devising. The truth is far simpler: there are things in the darkness beneath us that wish us harm.”</p>
            
              <p class="highlight__text">His head was lolled back on the armchair, and the tip of his tongue poked out of the corner of his mouth.</p>

The snow on his boots had not entirely melted.</p>
            
              <p class="highlight__text">“Perhaps. The end of the world is a strange concept. The world is always ending, and the end is always being averted, by love or foolishness or just plain old dumb luck.</p>

              <p class="highlight__text">A thin trickle of drool came from one corner of his mouth, oozed down in a thread of silver to his collar. Something scuttled from his collar into the shadows of his coat.</p>
            
              <p class="highlight__text">“Yeah? What happens when the moon rises?”</p>
            
              <p class="highlight__text">The man in the armchair stirred, opened two little eyes, red and swollen, and blinked them in waking.</p>
            
              <p class="highlight__text">“I dreamed I had many mouths,” he said, his new voice oddly small and breathy for such a huge man. “I dreamed every mouth was opening and closing independently. Some mouths were talking, some whispering, some eating, some waiting in silence.”</p>

They hid her face like a slow green veil.</p>

              <p class="highlight__text">She moved toward me. The weed that surrounded her head shifted. She had a face like the stuff you don’t want to eat in a sushi counter, all suckers and spines and drifting anemone fronds; and somewhere in all that I knew she was smiling.</p>
            
              <p class="highlight__text">I pushed with my hind legs. We met there, in the deep, and we struggled. It was so cold, so dark. I closed my jaws on her face and felt something rend and tear.</p>
            
              <p class="highlight__text">It was almost a kiss, down there in the abysmal deep...</p>

              <p class="highlight__text">The wind blew cold as Peter left the pub, setting the old sign swinging. It didn’t look much like a dirty donkey, thought Peter. More like a pale horse.</p>
            
              <p class="highlight__text">Peter was drifting off to sleep that night, mentally rehearsing his coronation speech, when a thought drifted into his head and hung around. It would not go away. Could he—could he possibly be passing up an even larger saving than he already had? Could he be missing out on a bargain?</p>
            
              <p class="highlight__text">Peter climbed out of bed and walked over to the phone. It was almost 3 A.M., but even so . . .</p>
            
              <p class="highlight__text">His Yellow Pages lay open where he had left it the previous Saturday, and he dialed the number.</p>
            
              <p class="highlight__text">The phone seemed to ring forever. There was a click and a bored voice said, “Burke Hare Ketch. Can I help you?”</p>
            
              <p class="highlight__text">“I hope I’m not phoning too late . . . ” he began.</p>
            
              <p class="highlight__text">“Of course not, sir.”</p>
            
              <p class="highlight__text">“I was wondering if I could speak to Mr. Kemble.”</p>
            
              <p class="highlight__text">“Can you hold? I’ll see if he’s available.”</p>
            
              <p class="highlight__text">Peter waited for a couple of minutes, listening to the ghostly crackles and whispers that always echo down empty phone lines.</p>
            
              <p class="highlight__text">“Are you there, caller?”</p>
            
              <p class="highlight__text">“Yes, I’m here.”</p>
            
              <p class="highlight__text">“Putting you through.” There was a buzz, then “Kemble speaking.”</p>
            
              <p class="highlight__text">“Ah, Mr. Kemble. Hello. Sorry if I got you out of bed or anything. This is, um, Peter Pinter.”</p>
            
              <p class="highlight__text">“Yes, Mr. Pinter?”</p>
            
              <p class="highlight__text">“Well, I’m sorry it’s so late, only I was wondering . . . How much would it cost to kill everybody? Everybody in the world?”</p>
            
              <p class="highlight__text">“Everybody? All the people?”</p>
            
              <p class="highlight__text">“Yes. How much? I mean, for an order like that, you’d have to have some kind of a big discount. How much would it be? For everyone?”</p>
            
              <p class="highlight__text">“Nothing at all, Mr. Pinter.”</p>
            
              <p class="highlight__text">“You mean you wouldn’t do it?”</p>
            
              <p class="highlight__text">“I mean we’d do it for nothing, Mr. Pinter. We only have to be asked, you see. We always have to be asked.”</p>
            
              <p class="highlight__text">Peter was puzzled. “But—when would you start?”</p>
            
              <p class="highlight__text">“Start? Right away. Now. We’ve been ready for a long time. But we had to be asked, Mr. Pinter. Good night. It has been a pleasure doing business with you.”</p>
            
              <p class="highlight__text">The line went dead.</p>
            
              <p class="highlight__text">Peter felt strange. Everything seemed very distant. He wanted to sit down. What on earth had the man meant? “We always have to be asked.” It was definitely strange. Nobody does anything for nothing in this world; he had a good mind to phone Kemble back and call the whole thing off. Perhaps he had overreacted, perhaps there was a perfectly innocent reason why Archie and Gwendolyn had entered the stockroom together. He would talk to her; that’s what he’d do. He’d talk to Gwennie first thing tomorrow morning . . .</p>
            
              <p class="highlight__text">That was when the noises started.</p>
            
              <p class="highlight__text">Odd cries from across the street. A catfight? Foxes probably. He hoped someone would throw a shoe at them. Then, from the corridor outside his flat, he heard a muffled clumping, as if someone were dragging something very heavy along the floor. It stopped. Someone knocked on his door, twice, very softly.</p>
            
              <p class="highlight__text">Outside his window the cries were getting louder. Peter sat in his chair, knowing that somehow, somewhere, he had missed something. Something important. The knocking redoubled. He was thankful that he always locked and chained his door at night.</p>
            
              <p class="highlight__text">They’d been ready for a long time, but they had to be asked. . .</p>
            
              <p class="highlight__text">When the thing came through the door, Peter started screaming, but he really didn’t scream for very long.</p>

              <p class="highlight__text">After all the dreaming is over, after you wake, and leave the world of madness and glory for the mundane day-lit daily grind, through the wreckage of your abandoned fancies walks the sweeper of dreams.</p>
            
              <p class="highlight__text">Who knows what he was when he was alive? Or if, for that matter, he ever was alive. He certainly will not answer your questions. The sweeper talks little, in his gruff gray voice, and when he does speak it is mostly about the weather and the prospects, victories and defeats of certain sports teams. He despises everyone who is not him.</p>
            
              <p class="highlight__text">Just as you wake he comes to you, and he sweeps up kingdoms and castles, and angels and owls, mountains and oceans. He sweeps up the lust and the love and the lovers, the sages who are not butterflies, the flowers of meat, the running of the deer and the sinking of the Lusitania. He sweeps up everything you left behind in your dreams, the life you wore, the eyes through which you gazed, the examination paper you were never able to find. One by one he sweeps them away: the sharp-toothed woman who sank her teeth into your face; the nuns in the woods; the dead arm that broke through the tepid water of the bath; the scarlet worms that crawled in your chest when you opened your shirt.</p>
            
              <p class="highlight__text">He will sweep it up—everything you left behind when you woke. And then he will burn it, to leave the stage fresh for your dreams tomorrow.</p>
            
              <p class="highlight__text">Treat him well, if you see him. Be polite with him. Ask him no questions. Applaud his teams’ victories, commiserate with him over their losses, agree with him about the weather. Give him the respect he feels is his due.</p>
            
              <p class="highlight__text">For there are people he no longer visits, the sweeper of dreams, with his hand-rolled cigarettes and his dragon tattoo.</p>
            
              <p class="highlight__text">You’ve seen them. They have mouths that twitch, and eyes that stare, and they babble and they mewl and they whimper. Some of them walk the cities in ragged clothes, their belongings under their arms. Others of their number are locked in the dark, in places where they can no longer harm themselves or others. They are not mad, or rather, the loss of their sanity is the lesser of their problems. It is worse than madness. They will tell you, if you let them: they are the ones who live, each day, in the wreckage of their dreams.</p>
            
              <p class="highlight__text">And if the sweeper of dreams leaves you, he will never come back.</p>

I was planning to get a little distance from the City—to fly above it, I mean, not to go into the Dark outside, I wouldn’t do that, although there has been some loose talk amongst . . .but, yes.

It’s one of the really major ones—the ones that I would usually handle, or possibly even Zephkiel.’ He glanced upward. ‘But Carasel had done such sterling work. And his last project was so remarkable. Something apparently quite trivial that he and Saraquael elevated into . . .’ he shrugged. ‘But that is unimportant.

              <p class="highlight__text">In the center of the Silver City was a park—a place of recreation and rest. I found the Angel Lucifer there, beside a river. He was just standing, watching the water flow.</p>
            
              <p class="highlight__text">“ ‘Lucifer?’</p>

              <p class="highlight__text">“ ‘How did you come upon the body?’</p>
            
              <p class="highlight__text">“ ‘I didn’t. Not exactly. I saw Phanuel standing in the street. He looked distressed. I inquired whether there was something wrong, and he showed me the dead angel. And I fetched you.’</p>
            
              <p class="highlight__text">“ ‘I see.’</p>
            
              <p class="highlight__text">“He leaned down, let one hand enter the cold water of the river. The water splashed and rolled around it. ‘Is that all?’</p>
            
              <p class="highlight__text">“ ‘Not quite. What were you doing in that part of the city?’</p>

              <p class="highlight__text">“ ‘It is my business, Lucifer. What were you doing there?’</p>
            
              <p class="highlight__text">“ ‘I was . . . walking. I do that sometimes. Just walk and think. And try to understand.’ He shrugged.</p>
            
              <p class="highlight__text">“ ‘You walk on the edge of the City?’</p>

              <p class="highlight__text">“ ‘Saraquael?’</p>
            
              <p class="highlight__text">“ ‘Hm? Oh, it’s you. Hello. Look at this. If you were to die and to be, let us say, put into the earth in a box, which would you want laid on top of you—a spider, here, or a lily, here?’</p>

              <p class="highlight__text">‘Yes, that’s what I think, too. But why? I wish . . .” He raised a hand to his chin, stared down at the two models, put first one on top of the box, then the other, experimentally. ‘There’s so much to do, Raguel. So much to get right. And we only get one chance at it, you know. There’ll just be one universe—we can’t keep trying until we get it right. I wish I understood why all this was so important to Him...</p>

              <p class="highlight__text">“He stared at the floor. Then he stared up, proudly, aggressively. And he smiled.</p>
            
              <p class="highlight__text">“ ‘I was.’</p>
            
              <p class="highlight__text">“ ‘Do you want to tell me about it?”</p>
            
              <p class="highlight__text">“ ‘No.’ A shrug. ‘But I suppose I must. Very well, then.</p>
            
              <p class="highlight__text">“ ‘We worked together. And when we began to work on Love . . . we became lovers. It was his idea. We would go back to his cell whenever we could snatch the time. There we touched each other, held each other, whispered endearments and protestations of eternal devotion. His welfare mattered more to me than my own. I existed for him. When I was alone, I would repeat his name to myself and think of nothing but him.’</p>
            
              <p class="highlight__text">“ ‘When I was with him . . .’ he paused. He looked down. ‘Nothing else mattered.’</p>
            
              <p class="highlight__text">“I walked to where Saraquael stood, lifted his chin with my hand, stared into his gray eyes. ‘Then why did you kill him?’</p>
            
              <p class="highlight__text">“ ‘Because he would no longer love me. When we started to work on Death, he . . . he lost interest. He was no longer mine. He belonged to Death. And if I could not have him, then his new lover was welcome to him. I could not bear his presence—I could not endure to have him near me and to know that he felt nothing for me. That was what hurt the most. I thought . . . I hoped . . . that if he was gone, then I would no longer care for him—that the pain would stop.</p>
            
              <p class="highlight__text">“ ‘So I killed him. I stabbed him, and I threw his body from our window in the Hall of Being. But the pain has not stopped.’ It was almost a wail.</p>
            
              <p class="highlight__text">“Saraquael reached up, removed my hand from his chin. ‘Now what?’</p>
            
              <p class="highlight__text">“I felt my aspect begin to come upon me; felt my function possess me. I was no longer an individual—I was the Vengeance of the Lord.</p>
            
              <p class="highlight__text">“I moved close to Saraquael and embraced him. I pressed my lips to his, forced my tongue into his mouth. We kissed. He closed his eyes.</p>
            
              <p class="highlight__text">“I felt it well up within me then: a burning, a brightness. From the corner of my eyes, I could see Lucifer and Phanuel averting their faces from my light; I could feel Zephkiel’s stare. And my light became brighter and brighter until it erupted—from my eyes, from my chest, from my fingers, from my lips: a white searing fire.</p>
            
              <p class="highlight__text">“The white flames consumed Saraquael slowly, and he clung to me as he burned.</p>
            
              <p class="highlight__text">“Soon there was nothing left of him. Nothing at all.</p>
            
              <p class="highlight__text">“I felt the flame leave me. I returned to myself once more.</p>
            
              <p class="highlight__text">“Phanuel was sobbing. Lucifer was pale. Zephkiel sat in his chair, quietly watching me.</p>
            
              <p class="highlight__text">“I turned to Phanuel and Lucifer. ‘You have seen the Vengeance of the Lord,’ I told them. ‘Let it act as a warning to you both.’</p>

              <p class="highlight__text">“Lucifer walked over to the place on the silver floor where Saraquael had once stood. He knelt, stared desperately at the floor as if he were trying to find some remnant of the angel I had destroyed, a fragment of ash, or bone, or charred feather, but there was nothing to find. Then he looked up at me.</p>
            
              <p class="highlight__text">“ ‘That was not right,’ he said. ‘That was not just.’ He was crying; wet tears ran down his face. Perhaps Saraquael was the first to love, but Lucifer was the first to shed tears. I will never forget that.</p>
            
              <p class="highlight__text">“I stared at him impassively. ‘It was justice. He killed another. He was killed in his turn. You called me to my function, and I performed it.</p>
            
              <p class="highlight__text">“ ‘But . . . he loved. He should have been forgiven. He should have been helped. He should not have been destroyed like that. That was wrong.’</p>
            
              <p class="highlight__text">“ ‘It was His will.’</p>
            
              <p class="highlight__text">“Lucifer stood. ‘Then perhaps His will is unjust. Perhaps the voices in the Darkness speak truly, after all. How can this be right?’</p>
            
              <p class="highlight__text">“ ‘It is right. It is His will. I merely performed my function.’</p>
            
              <p class="highlight__text">“He wiped away the tears with the back of his hand. ‘No,’ he said, flatly. He shook his head, slowly, from side to side. Then he said, ‘I must think on this. I will go now.’</p>
            
              <p class="highlight__text">“He walked to the window, stepped into the sky, and he was gone.</p>
            
              <p class="highlight__text">“Zephkiel and I were alone in his cell. I went over to his chair.</p>
            
              <p class="highlight__text">He nodded at me. ‘You have performed your function well, Raguel. Shouldn’t you return to your cell to wait until you are next needed?’ ” The man on the bench turned toward me: his eyes sought mine. Until now it had seemed—for most of his narrative—that he was scarcely aware of me; he had stared ahead of himself, whispered his tale in little better than a monotone. Now it felt as if he had discovered me and that he spoke to me alone, rather than to the air, or the City of Los Angeles. And he said:</p>
            
              <p class="highlight__text">“I knew that he was right. But I couldn’t have left then—not even if I had wanted to. My aspect had not entirely left me; my function was not completely fulfilled. And then it fell into place; I saw the whole picture. And like Lucifer, I knelt. I touched my forehead to the silver floor. ‘No, Lord,’ I said. ‘Not yet.’</p>
            
              <p class="highlight__text">“Zephkiel rose from his chair. ‘Get up. It is not fitting for one angel to act in this way to another. It is not right. Get up!”</p>
            
              <p class="highlight__text">“I shook my head. ‘Father, You are no angel,’ I whispered.</p>
            
              <p class="highlight__text">“Zephkiel said nothing. For a moment, my heart misgave within me. I was afraid. ‘Father, I was charged to discover who was responsible for Carasel’s death. And I do know.’</p>
            
              <p class="highlight__text">“ ‘You have taken your Vengeance, Raguel.’</p>
            
              <p class="highlight__text">“ ‘Your Vengeance, Lord.’</p>
            
              <p class="highlight__text">“And then He sighed and sat down once more. ‘Ah, little Raguel. The problem with creating things is that they perform so much better than one had ever planned. Shall I ask how you recognized me?’</p>
            
              <p class="highlight__text">“ ‘I . . . I am not certain, Lord. You have no wings. You wait at the center of the City, supervising the Creation directly. When I destroyed Saraquael, You did not look away. You know too many things. You . . .’ I paused and thought. ‘No, I do not know how I know. As You say, You have created me well. But I only understood who You were, and the meaning of the drama we had enacted here for You, when I saw Lucifer leave.’</p>
            
              <p class="highlight__text">“ ‘What did you understand, child?’</p>
            
              <p class="highlight__text">“ ‘Who killed Carasel. Or, at least, who was pulling the strings. For example, who arranged for Carasel and Saraquael to work together on Love, knowing Carasel’s tendency to involve himself too deeply in his work?’</p>
            
              <p class="highlight__text">“He was speaking to me gently, almost teasingly, as an adult would pretend to make conversation with a tiny child. ‘Why should anyone have “pulled the strings,” Raguel?’</p>
            
              <p class="highlight__text">“ ‘Because nothing occurs without reason; and all the reasons are Yours. You set Saraquael up: yes, he killed Carasel. But he killed Carasel so that I could destroy him.’</p>
            
              <p class="highlight__text">“ ‘And were you wrong to destroy him?’</p>
            
              <p class="highlight__text">“I looked into His old, old eyes. ‘It was my function. But I do not think it was just. I think perhaps it was needed that I destroy Saraquael, in order to demonstrate to Lucifer the Injustice of the Lord.’</p>
            
              <p class="highlight__text">“He smiled, then. ‘And whatever reason would I have for doing that?’</p>
            
              <p class="highlight__text">“ ‘I . . . I do not know. I do not understand—no more than I understand why You created the Dark or the voices in the Darkness. But You did. You caused all this to occur.’</p>
            
              <p class="highlight__text">“He nodded. ‘Yes. I did. Lucifer must brood on the unfairness of Saraquael’s destruction. And that—amongst other things—will precipitate him into certain actions. Poor sweet Lucifer. His way will be the hardest of all my children; for there is a part he must play in the drama that is to come, and it is a grand role.’</p>

              <p class="highlight__text">One night, several months after I was brought to the palace, she came to my rooms. She was six. I was embroidering by lamplight, squinting my eyes against the lamp’s smoke and fitful illumination. When I looked up, she was there.</p>
            
              <p class="highlight__text">“Princess?”</p>
            
              <p class="highlight__text">She said nothing. Her eyes were black as coal, black as her hair; her lips were redder than blood. She looked up at me and smiled. Her teeth seemed sharp, even then, in the lamplight.</p>
            
              <p class="highlight__text">“What are you doing away from your room?”</p>
            
              <p class="highlight__text">“I’m hungry,” she said, like any child.</p>
            
              <p class="highlight__text">It was winter, when fresh food is a dream of warmth and sunlight; but I had strings of whole apples, cored and dried, hanging from the beams of my chamber, and I pulled an apple down for her.</p>
            
              <p class="highlight__text">“Here.”</p>
            
              <p class="highlight__text">Autumn is the time of drying, of preserving, a time of picking apples, of rendering the goose fat. Winter is the time of hunger, of snow, and of death; and it is the time of the midwinter feast, when we rub the goose fat into the skin of a whole pig, stuffed with that autumn’s apples; then we roast it or spit it, and we prepare to feast upon the crackling.</p>
            
              <p class="highlight__text">She took the dried apple from me and began to chew it with her sharp yellow teeth.</p>
            
              <p class="highlight__text">“Is it good?”</p>
            
              <p class="highlight__text">She nodded. I had always been scared of the little princess, but at that moment I warmed to her and, with my fingers, gently, I stroked her cheek. She looked at me and smiled—she smiled but rarely—then she sank her teeth into the base of my thumb, the Mound of Venus, and she drew blood.</p>
            
              <p class="highlight__text">I began to shriek, from pain and from surprise, but she looked at me and I fell silent.</p>
            
              <p class="highlight__text">The little princess fastened her mouth to my hand and licked and sucked and drank. When she was finished, she left my chamber. Beneath my gaze the cut that she had made began to close, to scab, and to heal. The next day it was an old scar: I might have cut my hand with a pocketknife in my childhood.</p>
            
              <p class="highlight__text">I had been frozen by her, owned and dominated. That scared me, more than the blood she had fed on. After that night I locked my chamber door at dusk, barring it with an oaken pole, and I had the smith forge iron bars, which he placed across my windows.</p>
            
              <p class="highlight__text">My husband, my love, my king, sent for me less and less, and when I came to him he was dizzy, listless, confused. He could no longer make love as a man makes love, and he would not permit me to pleasure him with my mouth: the one time I tried, he started violently, and began to weep. I pulled my mouth away and held him tightly until the sobbing had stopped, and he slept, like a child.</p>
            
              <p class="highlight__text">I ran my fingers across his skin as he slept. It was covered in a multitude of ancient scars. But I could recall no scars from the days of our courtship, save one, on his side, where a boar had gored him when he was a youth.</p>
            
              <p class="highlight__text">Soon he was a shadow of the man I had met and loved by the bridge. His bones showed, blue and white, beneath his skin. I was with him at the last: his hands were cold as stone, his eyes milky blue, his hair and beard faded and lustreless and limp. He died unshriven, his skin nipped and pocked from head to toe with tiny, old scars.</p>
            
              <p class="highlight__text">He weighed near to nothing. The ground was frozen hard, and we could dig no grave for him, so we made a cairn of rocks and stones above his body, as a memorial only, for there was little enough of him left to protect from the hunger of the beasts and the birds.</p>
            
              <p class="highlight__text">So I was queen.</p>

              <p class="highlight__text">If it were today, I would have her heart cut out, true. But then I would have her head and arms and legs cut off. I would have them disembowel her. And then I would watch in the town square as the hangman heated the fire to white-heat with bellows, watch unblinking as he consigned each part of her to the fire. I would have archers around the square, who would shoot any bird or animal that came close to the flames, any raven or dog or hawk or rat. And I would not close my eyes until the princess was ash, and a gentle wind could scatter her like snow.</p>
            
              <p class="highlight__text">I did not do this thing, and we pay for our mistakes.</p>
            
              <p class="highlight__text">They say I was fooled; that it was not her heart. That it was the heart of an animal—a stag, perhaps, or a boar. They say that, and they are wrong.</p>
            
              <p class="highlight__text">And some say (but it is her lie, not mine) that I was given the heart, and that I ate it. Lies and half-truths fall like snow, covering the things that I remember, the things I saw. A landscape, unrecognizable after a snowfall; that is what she has made of my life.</p>

              <p class="highlight__text">A foolish woman would have gone then into the forest and tried to capture the creature; but I had been foolish once and had no wish to be so a second time.</p>
            
              <p class="highlight__text">I spent time with old books. I spent time with the gypsy women (who passed through our country across the mountains to the south, rather than cross the forest to the north and the west).</p>
            
              <p class="highlight__text">I prepared myself and obtained those things I would need, and when the first snows began to fall, I was ready.</p>
            
              <p class="highlight__text">Naked, I was, and alone in the highest tower of the palace, a place open to the sky. The winds chilled my body; goose pimples crept across my arms and thighs and breasts. I carried a silver basin, and a basket in which I had placed a silver knife, a silver pin, some tongs, a gray robe, and three green apples.</p>
            
              <p class="highlight__text">I put them on and stood there, unclothed, on the tower, humble before the night sky and the wind. Had any man seen me standing there, I would have had his eyes; but there was no one to spy. Clouds scudded across the sky, hiding and uncovering the waning moon.</p>
            
              <p class="highlight__text">I took the silver knife and slashed my left arm—once, twice, three times. The blood dripped into the basin, scarlet seeming black in the moonlight.</p>
            
              <p class="highlight__text">I added the powder from the vial that hung around my neck. It was a brown dust, made of dried herbs and the skin of a particular toad, and from certain other things. It thickened the blood, while preventing it from clotting.</p>

              <p class="highlight__text">I was bound and kept in a tiny stone cell beneath the palace, and I remained there through the autumn. Today they fetched me out of the cell; they stripped the rags from me, and washed the filth from me, and then they shaved my head and my loins, and they rubbed my skin with goose-grease.</p>
            
              <p class="highlight__text">The snow was falling as they carried me—two men at each hand, two men at each leg—utterly exposed, and spread-eagled and cold, through the midwinter crowds, and brought me to this kiln.</p>
            
              <p class="highlight__text">My stepdaughter stood there with her prince. She watched me, in my indignity, but she said nothing.</p>
            
              <p class="highlight__text">As they thrust me inside, jeering and chaffing as they did so, I saw one snowflake land upon her white cheek, and remain there without melting.</p>
            
              <p class="highlight__text">They closed the kiln door behind me. It is getting hotter in here, and outside they are singing and cheering and banging on the sides of the kiln.</p>
            
              <p class="highlight__text">She was not laughing, or jeering, or talking. She did not sneer at me or turn away. She looked at me, though; and for a moment I saw myself reflected in her eyes.</p>
            
              <p class="highlight__text">I will not scream. I will not give them that satisfaction. They will have my body, but my soul and my story are my own, and will die with me.</p>
            
              <p class="highlight__text">The goose-grease begins to melt and glisten upon my skin. I shall make no sound at all. I shall think no more on this.</p>
            
              <p class="highlight__text">I shall think instead of the snowflake on her cheek.</p>
            
              <p class="highlight__text">I think of her hair as black as coal, her lips, redder than blood, her skin, snow-white.</p>
