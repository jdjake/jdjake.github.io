            <p class="highlight__text">Why did Keynes' promised utopia -- still being eagerly awaited in the sixties -- never materialize? The standard line today is that he didn't figure in the massive increase in consumerism. Given the choice between less hours and more toys and pleasures, we've collectively chosen the latter. This presents a nice morality tale, but even a moment's reflection shows it can't really be true. Yes, we have witnessed the creation of an endless variety of new jobs and industries since the twenties, but very few have anything to do with the production and distribution of sushi, iPhones, or fancy sneakers.</p>

            <p class="highlight__text">What does it say about our society that it seems to generate an extremely limited demand for talented poet-musicians but an apparently infinite demand for specialists in corporate law? (Answer: If 1 percent of the population controls most of the disposable wealth, what we call ''the market'' reflects what *they* think is useful or important, not anybody else).</p>

        <li class="highlight" id="the+main+politi">
          
            <p class="highlight__text">The main political reaction to our awareness that half the time we are engaged in utterly meaningless or even counterproductive activities -- usually under the orders of a person we dislike -- is to rankle with resentment over the fact there might be others out there who are not in the same trap. As a result, hatred, resentment, and suspicion have become the glue that holds society together. This is a disasterous state of affairs. I wish it to end.</p>

        <li class="highlight" id="a+bullshit+job+">
          
            <p class="highlight__text">A bullshit job is a form of paid employment that is so completely pointless, unnecessary, or pernicious that even the employee cannot justify its existence even though, as part of the conditions of employment, the employee feels obliged to pretend that this is not the case.</p>

            <p class="highlight__text">It would appear to be a general truth that the more harm a category of powerful people do in the world, the more yes-men and propagandits will tend to accumulate around them, coming up with reasons why they are really doing good -- and the more likely it is that at least some of those powerful people will believe them.</p>

            <p class="highlight__text">Another distinction is between jobs that are pointless and jobs that are merely bad. I will refer to the latter as 'shit jobs', since people often do. These are two profoundly different forms of oppression. I certainly wouldn't want to equate them. Few people I know would trade in a pointless middle-management position for a job as a ditchdigger, even if htey knew that the ditches really did need to be dug. All I wish to emphasize is that each is indeed oppressive in its own way.</p>

        <li class="highlight" id="the+usual+compl">
          
            <p class="highlight__text">The usual complaint about capitalism is that it's *too* efficient, with private workplaces endlessly hounding employees with constant speed-ups, quotas, and surveillance. Obviously, I'm not going to deny that the latter is often the case. In fact, the pressure on corporations to downsize and increase efficiency has redoubled since the mergers and acquisitions frenzy of the 1980s. But this pressure has been directed almost exclusively at the people at the bottom of the pyramid, the ones who are actually making, maintaining, fixing, or transporting things. Anyone forced to wear a uniform in the exercise of his daily labors, for instance, is likely to be hard-pressed.</p>

            <p class="highlight__text">While I was conducting research, a number of women wrote to me or told me about their time as pole dancers, Playboy Club bunnies, frequenters of "Sugar Daddy" websites, and the like, and suggested that such occupations should be mentioned in my book. The most compelling argument to this effect was from a former exotic dancer, now professor, who made a case that most sex work should be considered a bullshit job because, while she acknowledged sex work clearly did answer a genuine consumer demand, something was terribly, terribly wrong with any society that effectively tells the vast majority of its female population they are worth more dancing on boxes between the ages of eighteen and twenty-five than they will be at any subsequent point in their lives, whatever their talents or accomplishments. If the same woman can make five times as much money stripping as she could teaching as a world-recognized scholar, could not the stripping job be considered bullshit simply on that basis? The only objection I could really raise here is that her argument might not go far enough. It's not so much that stripper is a bullshit job, perhaps, but that this situation shows us to be living in a bullshit society.</p>

            <p class="highlight__text">Tom didn't consider his job bullshit because he objected to consumer culture in itself. He objected because he saw his 'beauty work', as he called it, as inherently coercive and manipulative. He was drawing a distinction between what might be called honest illusions and dishonest ones. When you make dinosaurs attack spaceships, no one actually thinks that's real. Much as with a stage magician, half the fun is that everyone knows a trick is being played. When you subtly enhance the appearance of celebrities, in contrast, you are trying to change viewers' unconscious assumptions about what every reality *ought* to be like, so as to create an uncomfortable feeling that their lived reality is itself an inadequete substitute for the real thing.</p>

            <p class="highlight__text">To present a parable version: Imagine you are a feudal lord again. You acquire a gardener. After twenty years of faithful service, the gardener develops a serious drinking problem. You keep finding him curled up in flowerbeds, while dandelions sprout everywhere and the sedge begins to die. But the gardener is well connected, and getting rid of him would offend people you don't feel it would be wise to offend. So you acquire a new servant, ostensibly to polish the doorknobs or perform some other meaningless task. In fact, you make sure the person you get as doorknob polisher is actually an experienced gardener. So far, so good. The problem is, in a corporate environment, you can't summon a new servant, make up an impressive-sounding title for him, and tell him his real job is to take over when the gardener is drunk. You have to come up with an elaborate fake description of what a doorknob polisher would, in fact, do; coach your new gardener in how to pretend he's the best doorknob polisher in the kingdom; and then use the description of his duties as the basis of periodic box-ticking performance reviews. And if the gardener sobers up and doesn't want some young punk messing with his business -- now you have a full time doorknob polisher on your hands. This, according to Tania, is just one of the many ways that taskmasters end up creating bullshit jobs.</p>

Psychiatrist and psychoanalyst Francis Broucek called this the 'trauma of failed influence' and suspected that such traumatic experiences might lie behind many mental health issues later in life. If this is so, hten it begins to give us a sense of why being trapped in a job where one is treated as if one were usefully employed, and has to play along with the pretense that one is usefully employed, but at the same time, is keenly aware one is not usefully employed, would have devastating effects. It's not just an assualt on the person's sense of self importance, but also a direct attack on the foundations of the sense that one even *is* a self. A human being unable to have a meaningful impact on the world ceases to exist.</p>

In other words, the traditional student’s pattern of lackadaisical study leading up to intense cramming before exams and then slacking off again -- I like to refer to it as "Punctuated hysteria" -- is typical of how human beings have always tended to go about necessary tasks if no one forces them to act otherwise.</p>

The modern morality of 'You’re on my time; I’m not paying you to lounge around' is very different. It is the indignity of a man who feels he's being robbed. A worker's time is not his own.

He could also imagine buying the potter -- slavery was a familiar institution in the ancient world. But he would have simply been baffled by the notion that he might buy the potter's *time*. The closest he would have likely been able to come would be the idea of renting the potter as a slave for a certain limited time period. But for this very reason, he would probably find it impossible to locate a potter willing to enter into such an arrangement. To be a slave, to be forced to surrender one's free will and become the mere instrument of another, even temporarily, was considered the most degrading thing that could possibly befall a human being. As a result, the overwhelming majority of examples of wage labor that we do encounter in the ancient world are of people who are already slaves.</p>

Thompson, "Time Work Discipline, and Industrial Capitalism") The dissemination of domestic clocks and then pocket watches, coinciding largely with the advent of the industrial revolution beginning in the late 1700s, allowed for similar attitudes to diffuse among the middle classes more generally. Sidereal time, the absolute time of the heavens, had to come to earth and began to regulate even the most intimate daily affairs. But time was simultaneously a fixed grid, and a possession. Everyone was encouraged to see time as did the medieval merchant; as a finite property to be carefully budgeted and disposed of, much like money. What's more, the new technologies also allowed any person's fixed time on earth to be chopped up into uniform units that could be bought and sold for money. Once time was money, it became possible to speak of "spending time" rather than just "passing" it-also of wasting time, killing time, saving time, losing time, racing against time, and so forth. Puritan, Methodist, and evangelical preachers soon began instructing their flocks about the "husbandry of time" proposing that the careful budgeting of time was the essence of morality. Factories began employing time clocks; workers came to be expected to punch the clock upon entering and leaving; charity schools designed to teach the poor discipline and punctuality gave way to public school systems where students of all social classes were made to get up and march from room to room each hour at the sound of a bell, an arrangement self-consciously designed to train children for future lives of paid factory labor.</p>

Before long, however, workers were arguing with employers about hourly rates, demanding fixed-hour contracts, overtime, time and a half, the twelve-hour day, and then the eight-hour day. But the very act of demanding "free time;' however understandable under the circumstances, had the effect of subtly reinforcing the idea that when a worker was "on the clock;' his time truly did belong to the person who had bought it-a concept that would have seemed perverse and outrageous to their great-grandparents, as, indeed, to most people who have ever lived.</p>

Psychological studies, for instance, find that men or women who had experienced unrequited love during adolescence were in most cases eventually able to come to terms with the experience and showed few permanent emotional scars. But for those who had been the objects of unrequited love, it was quite another matter. Many still struggled with guilt and confusion. One major reason, researchers concluded, was precisely the lack of cultural models. Anyone who falls in love with someone who does not return their affections has thousands of years' worth of romantic literature to tell them exactly how they are supposed to feel; however, while this literature provides detailed insight on the experience of being Cyrano, it generally tells you very little about how you are supposed to feel-let alone what you're supposed to do-if you're Roxane.</p>

Nothing remotely along these lines has taken place. Instead, the situation has sparked an efflorescence of social media (Facebook, YouTube, Instagram, Twitter); basically, of forms of electronic media that lend themselves to being produced and consumed while pretending to do something else. I am convinced this is the primary reason for the rise of social media, especially when one considers it in the light not just of the rise of bullshit jobs but also of the increasing bullshitization of real jobs. As we've seen, the specific conditions vary considerably from one bullshit job to another. Some workers are supervised relentlessly; others are expected to do some token task but are otherwise left more or less alone. Most are somewhere in between. Yet even in the best of cases, the need to be on call, to spend at least a certain amount of energy looking over one's shoulder, maintaining a false front, never looking too obviously engrossed, the inability to fully collaborate with others-all this lends itself much more to a culture of computer games, YouTube rants, memes, and Twitter controversies than to, say, the rock 'n' roll bands, drug poetry, and experimental theater created under the midcentury welfare state. What we are witnessing is the rise of those forms of popular culture that office workers can produce and consume during the scattered, furtive shards of time they have at their disposal in workplaces where even when there's nothing for them to do, they still can't admit it openly.</p>

            <p class="highlight__text">Much of the confusion that surrounds debate about social issues in general can be traced back to the fact that people will regularly take these different explanations as alternatives rather than seeing them as factors at all operate at the same time. For example, people sometimes tell me that any attempt to explain bullshit jobs in political terms is wrongheaded; such jobs, they insist, exist because people need the money-as if this consideration had somehow never occurred to me before. Looking at the subjective motives of those who take such jobs is then treated as an alternative to asking why so many people find themselves in a position where the only way they can get money is by taking such jobs to begin with. It's even worse on the cultural-political level. It's even worse on the cultural-political level. There has come to be a tacit understanding in polite circles that you can ascribe motives to people only when speaking about the individual level. Therefore, any suggestion that powerful people ever do anything they don't say they're doing, or even do what they can be publicly observed to be doing for reasons other than what they say, is immediately denounced as a "paranoid conspiracy theory" to be rejected instantly. Thus, to suggest that some "law and order" politicians or social service providers might not feel it's in their best interest to do much about the underlying causes of homelessness, is treated as equivalent to saying homelessness itself exists only because of the machinations of a secret cabal. Or that the banking system is run by lizards.</p>

It's just assumed that they will-which, of course, means that often they won't. Similarly, when right-wing politicians call for tax cuts to put more money in the hands of "job creators;' they never specify whether those jobs will be good for anything; it's simply assumed that if the market produced them, they will be.</p>

The world is more complicated and messy than that. Historically, the factories and offices emerged first, long before anyone knew quite what to call them, and to this day, they operate on multiple contradictory logics and purposes. Similarly, value itself is a constant political argument. No one is ever quite sure what it is.</p>

As the examples I cited at the time make clear, people do really think in these terms when they reflect on the "social value" of their jobs. To think of labor as valuable primarily because it is "productive;' and productive labor as typified by the factory worker, effecting that magic transformation by which cars or teabags or pharmaceutical products are "produced" out of factories allows one to make all this disappear. It also makes it maximally easy for the factory owner to insist that no, actually, workers are really no different from the machines they operate.</p>

They stand for both greed and charity. Hence, the otherwise inexplicable alliance in the Republican Party between the free market libertarians and the "values voters" of the Christian Right. What this comes down to in practice has usually been the political equivalent of a strategy of good-cop-bad-cop; first unleash the chaos of the market to destabilize lives and all existing verities alike; then, offer yourself up as the last bastion of the authority of church and fatherhood against the barbarians they have themselves unleashed.</p>

This is the kind of question that concerned Aristotle, Confucius, and Ibn Khaldun, and in the final analysis it's still the only really important one. Human life is a process by which we, as humans, create one another; even the most extreme individualists only become individuals through the care and support of their fellows; and "the economy" is ultimately just the way we provide ourselves with the necessary material provisions with which to do so.</p>

If teachers were to rebel they'd have to rebel against school administrators who are actually represented, in many cases, by the exact same union. If they protest too loudly, they will simply be told they have no choice but to accept bullshitization, because the only alternative is to surrender to the racist barbarians of the populist Right.</p>

There's a little mental trick we often play on ourselves when discussing such matters. We say, for instance, "What are we going to do about the problem of X?" as if "we" were society as a whole, somehow acting on our­ selves, but, in fact, unless we happen to be pad of that roughly 3 percent to 5 percent of the population whose views actually do affect policy makers, this is all a game of make-believe; we are identifying with our rulers when, in fact, we're the ones being ruled.</p>

            <p class="highlight__text">(On Basic Income) Domestic violence goes way down. (This makes sense because I think some 80 percent of domestic disputes that lead to violence turn out to be about money.) But the main thing is, it starts to make social inequalities dissolve. You start by giving everyone an equal amount of money. That in itself is important, because money has a certain symbolic power; it's something that's the same for everyone, and when you give everyone, men, women, old, young, high caste, low caste, exactly the same amount, those differences start to dissolve.This happened in the Indian pilot where they observed that the girls were given the same amount of food as boys unlike before, disabled people were more accepted in village activities, and young women dropped the social convention that said they were supposed to be shy and modest and started hanging around in public like boys ...Girls started participating in public life.</p>

The compulsive workaholics who insist on doing far more than they really have to would more than compensate for the occasional slackers.</p>

            <p class="highlight__text">How do we create only games that we actually feel like playing, because we can opt out at any time? In the economic field, at least, the answer is obvious. All of the gratuitous sadism of workplace politics depends on one's inability to say "I quit" and feel no economic consequences.If Annie's boss knew Annie's income would be unaffected even if she did walk offin disgust at being called out yet again for a problem she'd fixed months ago, she would know better than to call her into the office to begin with.Basic Income in this sense would, indeed, give workers the power to say "orange" to their boss.</p>
