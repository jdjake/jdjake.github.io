          <p class="highlight__text">Part of what keeps you sitting in that chair in that room enduring harassment or abuse from a man in power is that, as a woman, you have rarely seen another end for yourself. In the novels you&#39;ve read, in the films you&#39;ve seen, in the stories you&#39;ve been told since birth, the women so frequently meet disasterous ends.</p>

          <p class="highlight__text">The word adult implies that all the people who&#39;ve attained legal majority makeup a coherent category, but we are all travelers who change and traverse a changing country as we go. The road is tattered and elastic. Childhood fades gradually in some ways, never ends in others; adulthood arrives in small, irregular installments if it arrives; and every person is on her own schedule, or rather, there is none for the many transitions.</p>

          <p class="highlight__text">We were not the intended audience for such art, including the stuff lauded as masterpieces and upheld as canonical. Sometimes the male protagonists protected women, particularly beautiful women, from other men, and protector was one face of their power, but destroyer was still the other face, and either one put your fate in their hands.</p>

One of the convenient afflictions of power is a lack of this imaginative extension. For many men it begins in early childhood, with almost exclusively being given stories with male protagonists.</p>

And the task of finding ones own way must be immeasurable harder when all the heroes, all the protagonists, are not only another gender but another race, or another sexual orientation, and when you find that you yourself are described as the savages or the servants or the people who don&#39;t matter. There are so many forms of annihilation.</p>

Burroughs was seen by some of the young people around me as exemplerary of all this, and he had spent a lot of time taking a lot of drugs, buffered by family allowance and an apparently iron constitution. The young man I knew had neither. I remember with affection one evening with him when he was hallucinating and wielding colored markers, trying to draw on paper (and album covers) and scrawling directly on the floor of the apartment. Then its with sadness that I remember him becoming more and more of a meth addict, and then a homeless person walking barefoot in dirty jeans on market street unable to recognize me. He was cared for by a kind older man for a while, and then I heard he jumped off the golden gate bridge, a sweet and talented young soul, dead of many things, including the prevailing mythology.</p>

          <p class="highlight__text">I&#39;d eventually realize that what I was doing could equally be characterized as stealing away the best excuse for doing nothing: that you have no power and nothing you do matters. It was nurture of people&#39;s sense of possibility, and it was dissent from a lot of the most familiar narratives in which despair and cynicism - that weird formula in which overconfidence about outcome undermines ones will to play a role - justify nonparticipation.</p>

          <p class="highlight__text">Works of art that had an impact in their time sometimes look dated or obvious because what was fresh and even insurrectionary about them has become the ordinary way things are, how we edit films or see history or nature or sexuality, or understand rights and their violations. Thus the vision of one or a few becomes the perspective of many. They have been rendered obselete by their success -- which makes the relevance of even much nineteenth century feminist writing a grim reminder that though we&#39;ve come far, its not enough.</p>

          <p class="highlight__text">Change is the measure of time, and these movements were often regarded as having failed to realize short term or specific goals but in the long term they often changed the very premises by which decisions were made and facts were interpreted, and how people imagined themselves, each other, their possibility, their rights, and society. And who decided, who intepreted, what was visible and audible, whose voice and vision mattered.</p>
