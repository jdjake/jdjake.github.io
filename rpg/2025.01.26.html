  <h4> <b> Summary </b> </h4>

The southern gate of Hirot loomed before the lone figure, its wooden beams darkened with age and weather, groaning softly in the wind. A single guard stood above, silhouetted against the pale sky, a hand resting warily on the hilt of his sword.

"Who goes there?" the guard barked, his voice hoarse with suspicion.

The traveler stepped forward, his cloak billowing behind him, and spoke with a calm, steady voice. "I am Logards, come to answer the call to protect this village."

The guard's eyes narrowed, but at last, he gave a slow nod. "Enter then, stranger. Gods know we need all the help we can get." The gate creaked open, revealing a village worn thin by fear and hunger.

The air was heavy with dread as Logards stepped inside. Faces peeked from behind shutters, and those gathered in the town square spoke in hushed tones. In the center stood a tall, weathered man — the Jarl — his stern expression creased with worry. Beside him, an ancient seer, his gnarled frame wrapped in a tattered robe, clutched a lockbox to his chest.

"What news from the outside world?" a villager asked, his voice brittle as dry twigs.

"The towns of East and West Troy flourish," Logards replied. "But this place—" his gaze swept the hollow-eyed crowd, "—this place smells of death."

At those words, the lockbox was unlatched, and the Jarl's voice rang out. "We draw the name," he declared, as though invoking an ancient rite. The seer, with shaking hands, reached within the box and pulled forth a small slip of parchment.

"Timothy O'Skyan," he read, his voice a whisper of doom.

A gasp rippled through the crowd. A boy — no more than ten summers — stumbled forward, his small frame trembling. He clutched his father’s hand until the man, Willow O'Skyan, gently pried him loose and stepped forward.

"Take me instead," Willow said, his voice rough with grief. "The boy is but a child. He wouldn’t even feed the beast."

"You speak of sacrifice as though it were a solution," Logards growled, stepping into the circle. "Yet I saw the scars on your gates, the blood on your stones. Did not the beast attack last night? Did it not tear through your homes despite your 'offering' then?"

The Jarl’s jaw tightened. "We do what we must until the seer finds a way. The beast cannot be harmed by mortal weapons."

From the crowd, an old priest stepped forward, wild-eyed and frantic. "We are guilty!" he cried. "The beast attacks because we drew a name not of our own blood last night — an outsider! The gods demand penance, not deception!"

Behind him, two figures — a man and a woman — lashed their own backs with leather cords, blood dripping to the frozen earth.

"Madness," Logards muttered. "Your seer prattles of lost weapons and forgotten kings. You sacrifice your children while you scour ancient scrolls for salvation. How many more will die before you face the truth?"

The Jarl's fists clenched, his knuckles white. "You know nothing of this place, outsider. We stand or fall by the will of Hirot."

Before Logards could speak again, a shout echoed through the village. Two guards ran from the Jarl’s hall, breathless.

"The family rings!" one cried. "They’ve been stolen during the lottery!"

The Jarl’s face darkened with fury. "Those rings are sacred — worn by my ancestors since the founding of Hirot!"

Logards' lips curled into a bitter smile. "You mourn for gold while a third of your people lie in shallow graves."

The crowd murmured, a slow, fearful ripple of dissent.

The seer hunched lower. "I need more time," he whispered. "Just a few more weeks to find the answer. We must continue the lottery until then."

"A week," Logards said, his voice a steel edge. "One week to find your solution. If not, then I will take matters into my own hands — and the beast will taste more than just fear."

The village of Hirot held its breath, caught between the will of its ancient traditions and the blade of an unyielding stranger.

The wind clawed through the village of Hirot like an unseen beast, rattling wooden shutters and howling through the thatched roofs. Smoke from dying hearths spiraled into the slate sky, and the air reeked of fear — a cloying, bitter scent that clung to the peasants like a second skin.

They huddled near the ancient stone wall, their eyes wide and darting, flinching at every creak and groan of the wind. No one dared venture beyond the safety of Hirot’s bounds. Beyond lay the wilderness — the dark woods where the beast prowled, a creature of claws, fangs, and malice. To step outside the village was to offer oneself to its hunger.

A man clad in travel-worn robes stood before the crowd, his back stiff, his fingers twitching at the edge of a weathered cloak. The seer. An outsider. He had come, he claimed, to aid Hirot in its time of peril — yet the beast had followed, and death had crept closer with every passing night.

A voice broke the uneasy silence.

"Did the beast only come when you arrived, Seer?" It was a man — a villager with a narrow face and a tongue sharp with fear. "How do we know you're not behind this? Are you collecting sacrifices to balance some dark power?"

The crowd murmured. Suspicion blossomed like a spreading stain.

The Seer's face darkened. "How dare you accuse me of such wickedness? I am no necromancer!" His words struck the air, but a whisper rippled through the villagers.

"You look like a necromancer," someone muttered, a cruel echo from the crowd.

"I came from the wilderness," the Seer said, his voice brittle with indignation. "I have a room at the Jarl’s mead hall. The Jarl would know if I was practicing dark arts! I am here to save Hirot — not destroy it!"

The Jarl, a grizzled man with a beard like frost-bitten iron, remained silent. His gaze rested on the Seer, but his thoughts were hidden behind a wall of stone.

A second voice rose, bold and biting. "You’ve been here for weeks, Seer — yet the beast still feasts! How many have died under your watch?"

"We have saved two hundred souls," the Seer snapped.

"And lost a hundred more!" the man countered.

The crowd stirred, a tide of doubt and desperation.

"The beast killed those people — not I!" the Seer’s voice cracked with frustration.

"You devised the lottery," the man sneered. "You pick names and call it salvation."

The priest stepped forward, his robes heavy with age and burden. "The lottery is penance," he said, his voice thin as a blade of grass. "The town is guilty — guilty of some unknown sin. Only sacrifice can appease the beast and bring us mercy."

"What sin have we committed?" came a timid voice from the back — a young boy, his face smudged with soot and fear.

The priest’s eyes closed for a moment, as if listening to a distant voice. "The ways of Justaseer are a mystery," he murmured. "We do not know the crime — only that repentance must be made."

Two figures at the edge of the crowd exchanged a glance. Wanderers — strangers themselves — who had fought beasts before and knew the stench of false prophets.

"The priest speaks of guilt," one whispered to the other. "Yet his name is never drawn in the lottery."

The other nodded, a grim line forming on his lips. "Perhaps the beast is not the only monster in Hirot."

And as the wind howled louder, the villagers drew their cloaks tighter — not just against the cold, but against the fear slithering through their hearts.

The sky above the village was a steel-gray canopy, the sun a pale eye straining through the clouds. The air hung heavy with dampness, and the scent of old woodsmoke and decay clung to the narrow, winding streets. A hollow drum echoed from the center of the town square, its rhythm a slow and solemn heartbeat.

The lottery box, a weathered wooden chest banded with black iron, sat atop a crooked post driven into the frozen earth. A single, rusted lock sealed its lid, the key entrusted to the seer—a gaunt figure draped in shadowy robes, his face a thin mask of disdain. He had long claimed the lottery was a tool of balance, a pact with forces unseen, ensuring the village's survival by offering one life to placate whatever ancient hunger gnawed at their borders.

Tonight, the villagers gathered like ghosts in the square, their faces lined with fear and resignation. Half the town had followed the grim procession to the standing stones, where Will the leatherworker was being bound to the sacrificial block—a silent man awaiting death, his son Timothy clinging to his leg until he was pried away.

In the square, three figures remained hidden beneath cloaks of dull gray, conspirators in the making. Their whispers were fierce yet quiet, like knives drawn in the dark.

"The necromancer," muttered one, his voice a rasp, "he's never placed his name in the lottery. It’s his system. His design. He'll never be drawn."

Another figure, taller and leaner, clenched a charcoal-stained hand into a fist. "If his name isn’t in the box—never was—that alone is injustice."

The third, a woman whose disguise was but a hasty smear of soot and a poorly drawn hood, offered a cruel smile. "We could steal the box. Rig the lottery. Slip in two hundred scraps of parchment, all bearing one name—his. Next drawing, we overturn the box, show the villagers. Make it clear it was never chance."

The lockbox loomed between them like a silent judge. Its surface was scarred from years of cold nights and reluctant hands.

"And the seer?" asked the tall one.

"We write his name. Two hundred times. No mistake in the hand," the woman said. "It must look as though the box conspired against him."

Above them, a raven cawed from the eaves of a sagging roof, black wings shuddering against the wind.

Distantly, at the standing stones, the crowd's chant rose to a low, mournful wail as Will was fastened to the block. The boy, Timothy, stood among the onlookers, his face buried in his mother’s skirt.

The cloaked figures exchanged a glance.

"Tonight," the rasping man said, "we begin."

The wind carried their pact away into the twilight.

The wind gnawed at the bones of the village, a thin, whispering breath that coiled through the crumbling stones of the keep. The sky hung heavy, a veil of mist rolling in from the dark woods beyond the walls, smothering the weak light of the afternoon sun. Cold and damp, the air clung to the skin like the touch of a long-forgotten ghost.

Bound to the iron bolts driven into the stone, the prisoner knelt, his mouth gagged to stifle any cries that might summon the beast. His eyes darted, wide with fear, a silent plea for mercy none would grant. The Jarl's decree had been final. It was the will of the lottery — the village's grim bargain to keep the creature at bay. Each night, one name drawn, one sacrifice made.

The Jarl stood before the gathered few, his weathered face a mask of resolve, yet his words dripped with unease. “This is the way,” he rasped, his voice swallowed by the mist. “It is all we can do to keep the beast from our throats.”

A voice broke the stillness — sharp, accusing. “And will your name ever leave the box, Jarl? Or does your hand always draw the names of others?”

The Jarl's jaw tightened, his fingers curling into a fist at his side. “If my name is drawn,” he said, “and none volunteer in my place, then I shall meet my end as any man must. But until then, who shall lead the village if I am gone?”

Silence.

The seer loomed at the edge of the gathering, his tattered robes brushing the frost-rimed ground. His pale eyes, clouded with sight beyond sight, flickered towards the dark woods. “The beast descends from the air,” he murmured, voice like wind rustling dead leaves. “Born of the mist, it hungers. It will come again.”

One of the warriors, a grim-faced man with a scar tracing his jaw, spat into the dirt. “Then we track it. The caves beyond the walls — it must lair somewhere.”

The Jarl shook his head. “I cannot spare more lives. My warriors guard the town, what few of them remain.”

A defiant voice rose again. “You would rather bind a man and wait for death than seek the monster's lair?”

“Order must be kept,” the Jarl growled. “Without me, there is no order.”

A bitter wind cut through the crowd. The prisoner shivered against the stone, the gag muffling his sobs.

The seer turned to the others, his voice a thin thread of sound. “The mist hides more than the beast. There are secrets in the caves — blood signs, ancient runes. I have seen them.”

The Jarl's advisor, Silaroo, whispered urgently in the Jarl’s ear. The Jarl’s gaze darkened.

“If you wish to die in the woods, then go,” the Jarl finally said, his voice a shard of ice. “But do not ask my warriors to follow you.”

A small band stepped forward — the defiant voice’s owner, a grim wizard with a dull gleam in his eye, and a few others, each clenching weapons or magic charms, faces set in grim determination.

The Jarl's final words chased them into the fog. “Find the beast’s lair if you can. But if you fail, another name will be drawn tomorrow.”

And behind them, as they left the village, the prisoner knelt in the silence — a living offering to the darkness that crept ever closer.

The wind howled through the skeletal remains of the village, its breath cold as a grave, scattering the ash of last night’s pyres into spiraling eddies. Brogan the Bull, a thick-shouldered man with a beard like bramble, sat by the tavern’s hearth, his great arms folded across his chest. Above him, a spear gleamed — or seemed to, though a keen eye would mark the luster for painted deceit. An imitation of the Wolf Spear of old, a relic of the savage kings who once ruled these lands, a weapon said to pin even the most fearsome of beasts to the frozen earth.

The mood was grim. The Jarl's rings, symbols of his dominion and favor of the gods, had been stolen. Worse still, the thief had defiled the Jarl’s goblet — a cup of lineage and lore — with a mark of contempt more vile than blood. To desecrate such an item after all the village had suffered was a wound beyond the flesh, a scorn against their honor.

Brogan’s voice rumbled like distant thunder. “You like the spear, eh?” His lips curled into a grimace that might have been a smile, though there was no mirth behind it.

A stranger, newly come to the village, lifted their gaze from the parchment they had been scribbling upon. “Aye,” they muttered, eyes fixed upon the weapon. “I like everything I see.”

The tavern was quiet but for the crackling fire, the whispered conversations, and the clink of mugs being filled with bitter ale. The tale of the Three Rat Gang slithered through the room like a serpent — a gang of petty thieves, more a nuisance than a terror, who left their mark with the bodies of three dead rats, stiff and cold, as their calling card.

“Amateurs,” someone scoffed.

But Brogan's jaw tightened. “They steal food. Trinkets. Nothing from the Jarl’s house. This… this was something more.”

Then, a new voice, softer yet edged with steel: “Where is the seer?”

“He went with the others,” Brogan said. “To the Sacrificing Stone. To deal with the one we tied up.”

The fire crackled, a log collapsing into embers.

Another, who had been writing names into the soot beneath the hearth — names of the dead or those yet to die, it was unclear — stood and stretched. “The witch’s hut lies quiet,” they muttered. “She will speak when the seer returns.”

And so the village waited — for justice, for vengeance, for something to break the suffocating grip of dread. Outside, the crematorium loomed, its entrance dark as a tomb, where three guards stood watch over a grisly heap of body parts, the remnants of the night’s massacre. A wheelbarrow sagged beneath its burden of severed limbs and broken flesh, and the air reeked of death.

“How many died last night?” one of the strangers asked, their voice little more than a growl.

Brogan did not answer at once, his gaze distant as though seeing ghosts only he could perceive. At last, he spoke, his words heavy as stone.

“Too many.”

The night pressed heavy upon the village of Blackmere, its streets cloaked in a veil of silent dread. Not a soul dared linger in the open, for the memory of the previous night’s slaughter still stained the cobblestones. Seven lives had been claimed—perhaps eight—their bodies now stripped of dignity and carted away to the crematorium.

A shadowed figure, cloaked in tattered wool, whispered to his companions, his voice a rasp like rusted iron. “Two guards slain,” he said, “their armor lies with the dead.”

Without a word, they moved through the alleyways, skirting the flickering torchlight like wolves circling a dying fire. The crematorium stood at the edge of the village, a squat stone structure with smoke still coiling from its chimney. Within lay the lifeless forms of the fallen—pale flesh draped in steel and leather. Grim-faced, the party stripped the guards of their tarnished armor, their every movement a silent mockery of the honor these men once bore.

“We wear their skins,” muttered one of the conspirators, a dwarf encased in plate mail that groaned with every step, “and walk as ghosts among the living.” His words carried no jest.

With the disguises donned, a plan took root. The hall of the thanes awaited, guarded still by those oblivious to the silent heist brewing in the dark. Yet, the lone entrance was a problem—a flame, they decided, would solve it.

“We set a fire,” said the leader, a figure whose face remained a shifting mask of shadow beneath his hood. “The guards will flock to it like moths, and the hall will stand unguarded.”

“And whose house shall burn?” asked another, their voice a whisper between fear and cruelty.

After a moment's silence, they chose an abandoned dwelling—its thatched roof dry as bone. With flint and steel, they conjured the blaze, the flames leaping hungrily into the sky. Smoke spiraled upward, a beacon of false danger.

“Fire! Fire!” the hooded leader bellowed, sprinting toward the guards stationed at the hall. His voice cracked with urgency, and the men, caught in the snare of panic, gathered their buckets and fled to quell the inferno.

Two figures, clad in stolen armor, slipped through the now-unguarded threshold of the hall. Within, the air hung thick with the scent of mead and old wood, the grand chamber lined with banners bearing the sigils of Blackmere’s ancient thanes. Four doors loomed at the far end, each a path to unknown secrets.

“Which way?” whispered the dwarf, his steps a muffled clank against the stone.

“The right,” said the leader.

Fate, however, is a cruel companion.

The door groaned open to reveal not an empty chamber but the thanes themselves—warriors of old, unbuckling their swords and placing their helms upon wooden racks. Their gazes fell upon the intruders like the weight of a falling axe.

“What is the meaning of this?” barked the eldest thane, his beard a silver river flowing over his breastplate.

“We are here to investigate,” replied the hooded one, his voice steady as a serpent in the grass. “The stolen rings—have they been recovered?”

Silence. Then a low rumble, not unlike distant thunder, as the thanes exchanged dark glances.

“Curious,” said the eldest.

Their hands, slow as glaciers, drifted back to their swords.

The torches along the stone corridor burned low, casting flickering shadows that danced like wraiths upon the rough-hewn walls. The air was thick with the scent of ancient dust and stale smoke, the weight of forgotten histories pressing down upon the intruders like an unseen hand.

Through the dim passage, a band of weary souls advanced, their boots echoing softly against the unpolished flagstones. They spoke in hushed tones — the jarl's bedchamber lay ahead, a silent sanctum veiled in suspicion and power. The leader, a grizzled warrior who had once stood watch upon the perimeter, now bore the scars of old battles and a quiet, simmering resolve.

"I took over from Ginny," he muttered, his voice like gravel scraping against steel. "I know the way."

A shadow at his side, a younger man with eyes sharp as flint, pressed forward. "The seer's chambers," he rasped. "Where were they?"

"Beyond the jarl's room," came the terse reply. "Near the ridge hall."

The company hesitated at the fork in the corridor — to the left, the jarl's quarters, heavy with secrets; to the right, the unexplored depths of the keep.

"We split here," said the leader, his voice a blade of command. "Seek what the seer may have hidden before his return."

The band broke apart, each warrior slipping into the gloom like a whisper on the wind. One found himself among the guards' barracks — a hall of iron bunks and stale air, where off-duty sentries slumbered, oblivious to the silent trespasser who slid beneath a tattered blanket, feigning rest like a serpent coiled beneath the snow.

Another ventured deeper — into a grand, neglected library. The air here was heavier, thick with the scent of forgotten tomes and the crumbling leather of ancient bindings. By a cold, stone hearth, an old man slumped in an armchair, his chest rising and falling in the shallow rhythm of sleep. The seer, or so it seemed.

Leather armor creaked softly as the intruder approached the desk cluttered with yellowed parchments and dusty volumes. There were no grimoires of sorcery or schematics of enchanted weapons — only the dull echoes of lineage and local legend.

"Ulfanaar," he whispered, his fingers tracing the title of an ancient book — a chronicle of the forgotten lord whose name still lingered like a curse upon these halls. He slipped the tome into his satchel, a quiet trophy pried from the jaws of neglect.

The seer did not stir.

The stone floor beneath the intruder's feet seemed to hold its breath, each worn slab a silent witness to this violation of sanctum and secrecy. Yet the warrior pressed on, rifling through drawers of discarded notes — records of fruitless searches, of whispered names and half-remembered prophecies.

And somewhere, beyond the walls of cold stone and dying firelight, the night itself seemed to pulse — a distant heartbeat of danger, creeping ever closer.

Beneath a sky choked with ashen clouds, the air hung thick with the scent of charred wood and something darker still — a hint of blood, of fear. The village of Varrenshade quivered in uneasy silence, broken only by the distant howl of a wolf or some other beast that stalked the encroaching night.

In the shadow of the ruined hall, a warrior named Thalric stood, his armor still bearing the soot of a house fire recently quelled. His cloak, once a proud crimson, now clung to him in damp tatters. Eyes the color of a storm's heart flicked from the darkened windows of the barracks to the huddled forms of his companions.

“I saw no sign of him,” Thalric growled, his voice like the grind of stone on steel. “Flush did not return.”

Eldra, the sorceress, ran a slender hand over the ancient journal they had taken from the mayor's bedchamber. Runes twisted across its surface — a cipher unknown to her, its meaning a thorn lodged in her mind.

“He went to explore,” Eldra murmured, “and now he is as smoke on the wind.”

Borin, the rogue, shifted uneasily. His hand toyed with the hilt of a dagger hidden beneath his cloak. “There were but four rooms in that accursed place: the council's chamber, the soldiers' barracks, the mayor's bedchamber where we found this journal, and the empty store-room. There is no other path.”

“Then he has either fled or fallen,” Thalric said, his jaw tightening.

Before the silence could devour their words, the barracks door creaked open. A lone figure emerged — a man clad in the rough garb of a guard, though his ill-fitting helmet slipped slightly over his brow. It was Flush.

“You fool,” Thalric spat. “You slept among them?”

Flush grinned, the reckless gleam of a man too often courting death. “Who would suspect an enemy to slumber in their den?”

Eldra's fingers whitened around the journal's spine. “And did your boldness bear fruit? Did you hear aught of use?”

Flush's smile faltered. “Only the murmurs of men lost in dreams. But I found this.”

From beneath his cloak, he produced another tome, thick and bound in cracked leather. The smell of old parchment mingled with something more sinister — a faint trace of rot.

Borin scowled. “We do not have the time to decipher both. Let us split the pages — divide the knowledge and hasten our path.”

“Tear the book?” Eldra hissed. “These words may be our only key.”

Thalric's voice was a blade's edge. “This is no scholar's parley. The night thickens, and something foul stirs within this village. We read, or we die.”

With grim resolve, they untied the ancient cord binding the pages, separating the text into three parts — knowledge scattered like bones awaiting the hand of a necromancer.

And outside, beneath the brooding sky, the beast howled once more.

The sun dipped beneath the jagged peaks of the Trolltooth Mountains, casting long, menacing shadows over the village of Harthwold. The sky, streaked with crimson and violet, seemed to bleed as the first distant howls echoed through the hills—wolves, though none of natural birth.

Within the dim confines of the great hall, a group of weathered adventurers pored over an ancient tome, its leather binding cracked with age, and its pages heavy with the scent of old ink and forgotten secrets. The book, The Tales of Ulfanaar, spoke of a long-dead king—an ancestor of the Jarl—whose spear, the Wolf Fang, had once bound a spirit of chaos.

Ulfanaar had faced the beast in those very mountains—no ordinary creature, but a wolf-thing of shadow and slaughter. It did not feast on flesh, but on suffering, growing stronger with each life it extinguished. The tribes of old had worshipped it, feeding it with blood and pain, until the king, in an act of grim resolve, drove his enchanted spear into the ground, pinning the wolf’s spirit to the earth. But the beast could not be slain by mere steel. No, it took a final act of sacrifice—Ulfanaar himself, dragging the weakened monster into the gaping maw of a great serpent, both devoured, sealing the wolf’s darkness away.

Now, the adventurers whispered among themselves, their words hushed as if the creature's name might summon it from the abyss. "The spear," muttered one, a grizzled warrior whose scarred hands gripped the hilt of his own blade too tightly. "If it still lies within these mountains... perhaps we can bind the beast again."

The sorceress, her eyes alight with an unnatural gleam, shook her head. "Binding is not enough. We must find a way to destroy it—for good. The snake that swallowed Ulfanaar and the wolf is long gone. Without it, the monster may rise anew."

A distant growl rumbled through the wooden walls of the hall. The torches flickered. "It’s the same time as last night’s attack," whispered another, his voice barely audible over the crackling fire.

Clad in their armor, weapons strapped tight, the company rose from the table. The Jarl's steward, a gaunt man with sunken eyes, met them at the entrance. "What brings you here?" he asked, though the question felt more like a plea.

"We come to guard your town," the warrior replied, his voice a low growl. "And to uncover the truth."

"Then enter," the steward said, pushing open the heavy doors of the hall. "Search the tomes, speak to the elders—find whatever you can before night fully claims the land."

A lone banner fluttered beside a locked strongbox in the center of the square—a wolf rampant against a dark field. An ill omen.

The howls grew louder.

In the cold, shadowed heart of the ancient village square, a weathered strongbox sat atop a splintered wooden post, ominous and unyielding. Its dark iron lock gleamed beneath the flickering torches that lined the area. Nearby, a tattered banner flapped in the chill wind—the symbol of a rampant wolf, jaws wide, claws reaching into the night sky. It stood as a forgotten sentinel of old power, an emblem of long-forgotten lords who had once ruled this cursed land. Now, only silence lingered, save for the occasional rustle of leaves and the low murmur of men searching for answers that had eluded them for too long.

Beneath the banner, three figures stood, draped in cloaks that fluttered like shadowy wraiths in the wind. Their faces were grim, weary from days of fruitless searching. One, a tall man with streaks of silver in his hair, muttered to himself as he scanned the tomes stacked around them, books filled with half-remembered legends and cryptic promises. His voice cut through the darkness.

“We must find it... something, anything,” he said, eyes darting over the worn pages. “The beast roams near, and we have no plan, no defense.”

His companions, equally haggard, exchanged glances. The younger of the two—a wiry, sharp-eyed youth—stepped closer to the strongbox, gazing at it as though it might offer some solution. But the lock remained firm, its secrets sealed behind cold metal. His voice was edged with frustration. “We’ve been at this for days. How can we fight what we do not understand?”

The older scholar waved a hand toward the scattered tomes. “These books... they speak of creatures of old, of ancient gods and beasts. Somewhere in these pages, there must be an answer. I’ve found legends—fragments of forgotten lore. They might lead us to something, but... fresh eyes might be better for it.”

The youth shook his head. “You’re chasing ghosts in the dark. Every legend we’ve uncovered has been little more than dust and dead names.”

A third voice, softer but no less weary, rose from the shadows—an old woman wrapped in layers of frayed cloth. Her face was hidden beneath a cowl, her hands gnarled from time and toil. She moved like a wisp of smoke, drifting between the rows of books, her eyes scanning the spines as though seeking something long-lost. “The wolf of the banner,” she whispered. “The stories say it was a protector once, but like all things, it has turned dark. It hungers now. It hunts.”

The wind howled, cold and biting, and the torches flickered, casting long, serpentine shadows across the square. The scholar closed his book with a snap and glanced toward the locked box. “Perhaps there is something within that chest,” he said. “Something forgotten, something hidden. If we could open it—”

The youth scoffed, turning away. “More dead ends. The lock is unyielding, just like everything else here.”

The old woman’s hand hovered over a book, her voice barely a whisper. “The key... might not be metal.”

Silence fell again, thick as the encroaching night. The beasts that roamed the edges of the village were growing bolder. Their howls, faint but unmistakable, echoed through the dark woods that hemmed in the forsaken place. The men exchanged another glance, this one laden with unspoken dread.

“Time is running out,” the scholar said. His voice was a mere rasp now, as if the weight of hopelessness had settled on his chest.

The youth clenched his fists, pacing. “Two weeks, you said. Two weeks to find something—anything to fight the beasts. But what have we found? Words. Just words.”

“There is power in words,” the old woman murmured, her gaze never leaving the tomes. “In the old days, words could summon storms, could fell kings.”

“But not here,” the youth growled. “Not now.”

The night deepened, the cold growing sharper. They huddled closer to the torches, their breaths misting in the air. For a long time, none spoke. Then, the scholar let out a long, slow breath, his eyes heavy with doubt. “Perhaps we’ve been looking in the wrong place.”

The youth turned to him, his voice low and dangerous. “And where, exactly, should we look then?”

Before the scholar could answer, a long, mournful howl cut through the night—a sound so deep and primal it shook the very ground beneath their feet. The torches flickered violently, and for a moment, the shadows seemed to dance in grotesque shapes. The beasts had drawn closer.

“There's no time left,” the scholar whispered. “We must act now.”

The old woman’s hand fell away from the book she had been studying. She straightened slowly, her eyes sharp beneath her cowl. “The wolf of the banner... it was a guardian once. Maybe it can be again.”

“How?” the youth demanded, his voice shaking with fear and frustration.

She stepped toward the strongbox, her gnarled fingers tracing the ancient lock. “Not with steel or fire,” she murmured. “But with blood.”

A silence fell, heavy and foreboding. The scholar took a step back, his eyes widening with realization. The youth’s breath caught in his throat.

The old woman turned to them, her voice as cold as the night wind. “We need a sacrifice.”

Another howl echoed across the village square, closer now, and the air seemed to grow darker still.

The air was heavy with dread as the council gathered in the mead hall. Shadows flickered from the fire’s glow, casting long, dark shapes that seemed to dance and whisper at the edges of the room. Galdric, the leader of this forsaken village, stood with a furrowed brow, gazing out the narrow window toward the mist-shrouded hills. In the distance, the faint howls of the beast echoed across the land, a reminder of the terror that gripped their souls.

“The beast has taken more tonight,” Galdric began, his voice low and strained. “We cannot wait any longer.”

Ragni, a grizzled warrior with a deep scar running down his face, clenched his fists. “People are dying,” he said through gritted teeth. “We have no choice but to make the sacrifice.”

The room fell silent, each man and woman present knowing the weight of those words. The old seer, draped in tattered robes, huddled near the fire, his eyes distant as if peering into some unseen realm.

“We’ve done this before,” Galdric continued, “but the beast comes again, stronger each time. What hope is left for us?”

A murmur of agreement rippled through the crowd. The village had long suffered under the curse of the creature, a monstrous wolf said to have been bound by a king of old. But now, its shackles had shattered, and it roamed free, ravaging the land with insatiable hunger.

“Why do you trust the seer?” Ragni spat, his voice a growl. “He claims to see, but what has he truly shown us? Nothing but vague riddles and empty promises.”

“He has power,” Galdric replied, though even he seemed unsure. “He may be our only hope.”

The seer stirred, lifting his head slightly. His voice was barely a whisper, yet it carried an eerie weight. “I see... the mountains... the weapon... long lost, but not forgotten.”

A hush fell over the room as the villagers exchanged uneasy glances.

“The weapon that bound the beast,” the seer murmured. “It lies buried deep within the mountains... waiting.”

Galdric's heart sank. The mountains were vast, treacherous, and unforgiving. To search for the weapon in such a place was a fool’s errand. Yet, what other choice did they have? The beast would not stop until every last villager lay dead.

“I heard a tale,” one of the villagers said suddenly, a nervous tremor in his voice. “A witch lives in the woods, untouched by the beast’s wrath. They say she possesses magic, protective garments that can shield one from the creature’s claws.”

“A witch?” Ragni scoffed. “Superstitious nonsense.”

“Not nonsense,” the villager insisted. “But there’s a price. She will only help if... if someone marries her.”

The hall fell into an uneasy silence once more. Eyes darted toward Galdric. He, the leader, stood alone—unwed and without an heir.

“I will not marry a witch,” Galdric said quietly, his tone resolute. “I won’t give in to dark magic.”

Ragni’s scarred face twisted into a grim smile. “Better to marry a witch than let our people be slaughtered like lambs. Or do you care so little for your village?”

Galdric stiffened, his eyes narrowing. “You think so lightly of it? You’re no fool, Ragni. No man here would dare wed her.”

“And yet,” the seer croaked, “the choice remains. The witch’s magic or the beast’s fangs.”

Galdric closed his eyes, his mind racing. The whispers of his people seemed to swell around him, their fears palpable in the air. The beast would return again, as it always did, and with it, another sacrifice. His people would bleed for his indecision.

“I will not marry her,” Galdric repeated, though his voice now wavered with doubt.

“What then?” Ragni growled. “Shall we send more to die tomorrow? Shall we cower while the beast grows fat on our kin?”

“Enough!” Galdric barked, his voice cracking like a whip. “I will send out a search party. We will seek the weapon in the mountains, and if the witch can be trusted, we will speak with her—but I will not sacrifice myself to her.”

The fire flickered once more, casting Galdric’s shadow tall upon the wall, the silhouette of a man torn between his duty and his fear. The howling in the distance grew louder, and the villagers shuddered.

“The beast will not wait,” the seer whispered.

As Galdric turned to face the gathering, he saw the faces of his people—gaunt, terrified, and filled with desperate hope. Their lives rested in his hands.

The night had settled like a heavy shroud over the village, the moon barely a sliver in the sky. The air hung thick with the scent of damp earth, the chill biting through layers of furs. The Jarl walked ahead, his broad shoulders framed against the distant glow of hearthfires. His shadow stretched long and thin, twisting like a serpent along the cobblestones. I trailed behind him, my breath a fog in the cold night air, my hand resting on the hilt of my sword.

It was our nightly ritual—a walk beneath the stars, away from the ears of the hall’s warriors and advisors. The Jarl, a figure of power and calm, needed this respite, this time to think and plan. And I, his seer, his advisor, whispered truths only he could hear.

“We must act soon,” I murmured, my voice low as I stepped closer. “The beasts will not wait for us to be ready.”

The Jarl grunted, his eyes fixed on the dark horizon. He said nothing, but I knew the weight of his silence. It was the same every night—discussions of strategy, of protection, of the growing unease that crept through the village like a sickness. The beasts had been sighted again, wolves larger than horses, with eyes like embers and teeth sharp enough to tear through chainmail. They came with the winter winds, hunting men as easily as deer.

Behind us, a voice broke the quiet. One of the newcomers, a stranger who had arrived that very morning, approached with an unsettling persistence.

"Let me join you," the stranger called, his voice echoing in the night. He stepped forward, his cloak fluttering like a raven's wing. "Surely, you promised the town more transparency."

The Jarl's face hardened beneath his thick beard. His hand moved, as if to wave the stranger away, but I placed my palm on his arm, stilling him. "You are not of this village," I said coldly. "You do not understand the dangers we face."

The man’s eyes flickered with something unreadable. "Then why not let someone from the village join you?" he pressed.

I turned, my gaze sweeping over the silent houses, the flickering lanterns hanging by the doors. "This is not a matter for many ears."

The Jarl exhaled, a deep sound of frustration, but before he could speak, another figure approached from the shadows. Garrett, one of the Jarl’s trusted sentries, stepped into the pale light of the moon, his hand resting on the pommel of his axe.

"I'll go with them," Garrett said, his voice like the rasp of steel on stone. "We can’t afford to let our guard down, not with what’s out there."

The Jarl nodded, his face softening at the sight of Garrett. "Very well. Come with us."

And so, we moved through the village in silence, our footsteps the only sound on the empty streets. The wind whispered through the trees, carrying with it the scent of decay from the woods beyond. As we walked, I whispered to the Jarl, low and cautious. The stranger remained a few paces behind, but I could feel his eyes on us, his curiosity like a blade at my back.

We stopped at the town square, where the lockbox sat—an ancient chest bound in iron, holding the village’s most valuable secrets. I knelt beside it, my fingers brushing the worn metal. "It is safe," I whispered, glancing at the Jarl. "For now."

The Jarl’s eyes narrowed. He did not trust the box’s safety, nor did I, but there was little we could do this night. The beasts were close, and our men were few.

As we rose to leave, the stranger spoke again. "There’s something more, isn't there?" His voice was soft, but there was an edge to it, a knowing that made my skin prickle.

I turned to face him, the cold seeping deeper into my bones. "What do you think you know of this village, outsider?"

He smiled, a thin, humorless grin. "I know enough."

I watched him carefully, my hand tightening on the hilt of my sword. There was more to this man than met the eye, and I did not trust him. The Jarl, too, was silent, his gaze lingering on the lockbox before turning away.

"We should return," the Jarl said, his voice low and heavy with the weight of command. "The night is not yet over, and the beasts will come soon enough."

As we walked back, the darkness seemed to press in around us, the distant howls of wolves echoing in the wind. There were dangers here, dangers we could not yet see, and I feared that our village was not ready for the blood that was soon to be spilled.

The sky darkened to a brooding indigo as the village sat still, enveloped by a cold wind that hissed through the trees like a whisper of dread. The moon, full and heavy, cast long, twisted shadows over the empty streets, where the cobbled stones echoed faint memories of laughter—now silenced. A wolf's cry pierced the distance, a mournful wail that lingered in the brittle air, only to be swallowed by the night.

A band of warriors gathered around a dimly lit fire near the meat hall, their faces grim and weary, their eyes gleaming with suspicion. The scent of wolfsbane hung in the air, sharp and acrid, mixed with the stale sweat of battle and the iron tang of blood. One of them, a grizzled man with wild hair and eyes that seemed to have seen too many horrors, spoke, his voice barely above a murmur.

“We pass the wolfsbane to those who wish it, but none dare ingest it. Yet the beasts come still, their hunger unquenched. What power does it hold if we cannot even wield it?”

Another warrior, lean and gaunt, nodded but remained silent, his gaze fixated on the treeline where the forest yawned open like a waiting maw. The Jarl had spoken of a seer—an old and twisted creature who might know the fate of the village, who might understand why the wolves came every dusk to tear at their doors, leaving only death in their wake.

“The seer,” muttered the grizzled warrior. “She walks with the Jarl, yet her answers are as vague as the mist that clings to these cursed woods.”

One of the younger men shifted uneasily, his hand gripping the hilt of his sword. “The seer was with him last night, was she not? When the wolves attacked. She escaped—unscathed.”

“Aye,” replied the grizzled one, eyes narrowing. “And the Jarl... he barely survived.”

Silence followed, broken only by the crackle of fire and the soft murmur of the wind. The weight of unspoken thoughts hung between them. Could the seer be trusted? Or was she in league with the very beasts that plagued them?

As if summoned by their doubts, a shadow stirred from the far side of the fire, where a figure loomed, cloaked in the same darkness that covered the land. It was one of the guards, his face pale, sweat beading at his brow.

“The wolves...” he stammered, voice quivering. “They are gathering. I saw them at the edge of the wood.”

The warriors exchanged glances, their hearts tightening with a fear none would admit. They were men of battle, hardened by years of bloodshed, yet the wolves... there was something else to them—something ancient and malevolent, far beyond the reach of their blades.

“We should speak with the seer,” the young warrior suggested. “If she knows something... anything about these beasts, we must know before it’s too late.”

The grizzled one spat into the fire, its embers hissing in protest. “The seer speaks in riddles. But perhaps tonight, we will find her truths.”

They rose as one, moving through the night like shadows themselves, toward the place where the seer lay—the meat hall, where she had retired with the Jarl and his closest guards. Inside, the air was thick with smoke and the smell of burnt meat. The warriors could hear the soft sounds of breathing as they passed the sleeping men. Weapons lay within easy reach of their hands, fingers still twitching as if in a restless dream.

In the corner, near the Jarl’s throne, lay the seer. She was a slight, withered figure, her face hidden by the hood of her dark robe. She looked frail, harmless—yet something about her presence felt wrong, like a weight pressing on the soul. Her breath came in slow, deliberate rasps, her body unmoving, as though she were a part of the night itself.

“Seer,” the grizzled warrior called out, his voice thick with doubt. “You know the wolves. You must know why they come.”

The seer stirred slightly, but did not rise. Her voice, when it came, was thin and cold, like the wind that howled outside. “The wolves come for what was promised.”

“Promised?” the young warrior demanded, stepping forward. “Who promised them? And why?”

The seer’s head tilted ever so slightly, and beneath her hood, her lips curled into a smile that sent shivers through the warriors. “The pact was made long before your time. The wolves do not hunger for flesh alone. They hunger for the life that was stolen from them. The Jarl knows this. He always has.”

The Jarl stirred in his sleep, but did not wake. The grizzled warrior’s hand tightened around the hilt of his axe. “You speak in riddles, woman. What life? Whose?”

The seer’s eyes, glowing faintly beneath her hood, locked onto the Jarl’s sleeping form. “The Jarl's... his bloodline is the curse. And it is his blood that will sate the wolves.”

The warriors recoiled, a sudden cold settling over them. The young warrior’s voice trembled with disbelief. “The Jarl? But... he’s our leader. Our protector.”

The seer’s smile widened, and her voice dropped to a whisper that seemed to echo in their minds. “And it is his death that will protect you.”

Outside, the wolves howled once more, closer this time—an ancient and dreadful sound, as though the night itself had come alive, hungry for what was owed.

The warriors knew then that dawn would not bring light, but blood.

The fire's glow flickered, casting strange shadows in the dim room as the widow Yemay sat in her dark corner. Her gaunt, wrinkled hands moved with unsettling precision, knitting thread pulled from the flames themselves. The fire’s golden threads spiraled around her fingers, weaving into a strange garment, a jumper of shimmering light that flickered in the cold air. The crackling of the fire seemed to mirror her dry, brittle voice when she spoke, her eyes, clouded with the passage of years, glimmering with ancient knowledge.

"You’ve been busy, haven’t you?" she whispered, barely glancing up from her endless task. "Learning more about the town’s secrets... the legends." Her tone was laced with bitter amusement, the hint of a smile tugging at her cracked lips. "I’ve heard the whispers."

The figure before her shifted uneasily, caught between the warmth of the fire and the ice in the old woman’s gaze. "I didn’t steal anything," they replied, uncertain if the words were meant to reassure her or themselves.

Yemay chuckled darkly, her laugh more like the hiss of dying embers. "Oh, Patrick’s doing well," she said, her voice lilting with mock affection. "Sleeping in my bed. He’d make a fine husband, wouldn’t he? Strong, quiet... a sense of duty. What more could a woman ask for in her twilight years?"

Her knitting needles clacked together, each stroke of thread a heartbeat in the otherwise still night. The person standing before her watched in morbid fascination as the golden threads continued to spin from the fire, shaped by her withered fingers into something unnatural, something that seemed to pulse with a life of its own.

"Why do you come here so late?" she asked suddenly, her voice sharp and cutting through the silence. "It’s dangerous to walk the roads after dark." Her pale eyes darted toward the window, as if seeing beyond the walls to the shadows lurking outside.

"I’ve been thinking about your offer," came the reply, hesitant. "The protections... you said you could help."

Yemay’s smile widened, her lips stretching too far over yellowed teeth. "Oh, I can offer more than simple charms, child. The dead weave power into their bones, and I know the secrets to bind that power." Her eyes gleamed in the firelight. "Manacles to chain a beast, fetters to hold back the darkness… I could make such things, yes."

"How?" came the question, tentative but curious. "How do you bind the dead?"

The widow leaned forward, the firelight casting her face in grotesque shadows. "It’s woven into these very walls," she rasped. "The hair of the dead. That’s what keeps us safe, what binds the spirits. The bones protect this house from the evils that walk the night."

The figure before her shuddered but held their ground. "What would it take to gain your help?" they asked, the question barely a whisper.

The widow paused, her knitting needles slowing, her eyes narrowing as if measuring the soul before her. "Bring me the hair of the dead," she said finally, her voice low and menacing. "A simple offering, and I will weave you the manacles you need. But bring it before the next moonrise. Time is a fickle thing, and the dead grow restless."

The air seemed to thicken, the fire’s glow dimming as the words hung in the air like a curse. The widow resumed her knitting, the sound of the needles like bones rattling in a grave.

As the figure left, Yemay’s voice followed them like a whisper carried on the wind. "You remind me of my first husband," she mused. "Strong... but not as clever as he thought." A dry laugh echoed in the room, swallowed by the fire's crackle. "Bring me the hair, and perhaps I’ll tell you how he met his end."

Outside, the night pressed in, thick with unseen eyes and lurking dangers. The moon hung low, casting its pale light over the land. The widow Yemay’s house, nestled in the hollow of a forgotten hill, seemed to breathe with its own life, the woven walls whispering secrets only the dead could hear.

The journey to the crematorium was long, and the shadows stretched across the path, twisting and curling like the fingers of long-dead things. Three guards stood vigil at the gates, their eyes gleaming in the torchlight.

"Who goes there?" one called, his voice hard like iron. "What business do you have with the dead at this hour?"

The figure hesitated but steeled themselves, remembering the widow’s words. "I come at the seer’s bidding," they answered. "He told me to examine the bodies... to search for signs of something more than the wolf attacks that plagued the town."

The guards exchanged glances, wary. "At this hour?" one scoffed, eyeing the stranger with suspicion. "The dead are at rest. Come back in the morning if the seer wishes to meddle with corpses."

The figure pressed on, their voice steady. "The seer said it must be done tonight. There is no time to wait."

The guards’ expressions hardened, but they stepped aside reluctantly. "Do what you must," one muttered, his eyes lingering on the shadowy figure as they passed. "But be quick about it. The dead don’t like to be disturbed."

Inside the crematorium, the air was thick with the scent of ash and decay. The bodies lay still, their faces twisted in final moments of terror. With careful hands, the figure cut the strands of hair from the corpses, their fingers trembling as they worked.

The dead offered no protest, but the silence that followed was deafening.

By the time the moon sank low and the horizon began to pale, the figure returned to Yemay’s house, the hair of the dead clutched tight in their hands. The widow was waiting, her knitting complete, the jumper of golden thread folded neatly on her lap.

"Good," she whispered, her eyes gleaming with dark satisfaction. "You have what I need. Now, let the weaving begin."

And with that, the fire burned brighter, its flames rising high, casting the room in an eerie light as the widow began her dark work once more.

The fire had long since dimmed, casting the great hall into a veil of shadows. The scent of old wood and dying embers mingled with the stale breath of peasants, restless in the uneasy night. Low murmurs drifted across the room as dice clattered on the floor, their echoes swallowed by the heavy silence. The haggard figures, sleepless, hovered between sleep and vigilance, their faces as drawn and pale as the moon outside.

A man stood at the edge of the hall, his face obscured beneath a ragged hood. His hand rested on the hilt of a blade, fingers drumming as if it would soothe his unease. The mound loomed in his mind—a twisted memory, darkened by the horrors whispered of it. "I will take the mound," he muttered to himself. "And the hair off the corpse, before the dawn claims us all."

Across from him, an old man stirred in his sleep, wrapped in a filthy robe. His hands twitched, and then, a sudden stillness overtook him, as though the shadows had finally won him over. The mound had claimed its next victim. "He sleeps in his own hair now," another voice said—a low, guttural laugh that lingered in the air like the stench of decay. "No need to fear him waking."

Beyond the walls, wolves howled at the rising moon, a bone-chilling sound that gnawed at the bones of the men gathered in the hall. Yet, no scream followed. The beast had not yet feasted on human flesh this night, though the silence in its wake weighed heavily.

By the hearth, a man—his face grim and eyes sunken—spoke with a seer. "The lockbox… you said it was useless, and yet the seers nap here, in the very hall where their knowledge festers." His voice was sharp, filled with suspicion and fear. "Where is the key?"

The seer’s laugh came like a hiss, his hands hidden deep within his robe. "It’s here," he whispered, tapping his chest, where the key lay concealed. "But what good is a key to a door that no longer stands?"

A gust of wind swept through the hall, chilling those within, as if the very mound itself breathed upon them. "We keep watching the seer," another said, eyes narrowing toward the old man by the fire. "Perhaps we gain something yet—beyond mere silver or trinkets. Maybe truth."

Rumors floated amidst the villagers, tales of creatures banished by the church, rites of exorcism that faltered against the beast’s ancient will. "The priest’s assistants tried," one muttered. "Tried to cast it away. But nothing stops the curse. The wolf… it does not care for prayers or banishments. It thrives on the blood that flows in the night."

As the dice fell again, and more coins were lost in the game, the moon hung heavier in the sky. The cold stone of the mound called them all. It would be a night to remember.

In the pallor of dawn, the village lay shrouded beneath a veil of mist, its bleak stones and thatched rooftops appearing as little more than ghostly silhouettes against the grey morning. A raven's call pierced the silence, rousing the men from their fitful sleep. The innkeeper had been chosen—there was no escaping fate. The elders had drawn lots, and it was his name, Brogan, that fate had selected for the sacrifice.

The church stood near the center of the village, an old ruin weathered by countless winters. Inside, a handful of priests huddled around the altar, their faces pale with fear. They had attempted the old banishment rites, whispering incantations in the tongue of their dead god. But the beast was beyond the reach of prayers. Even the holy wards carved into the stone walls seemed impotent before it, leaving them helpless.

“What did you learn?” one of the villagers asked, his voice barely rising above the wind’s mournful whistle.

“A creature immune to our rituals,” the priest muttered. “Not even the sacred words can drive it away.”

The beast—a thing of ancient terror, prowling the forests by night—had already claimed many lives. A creature so dark, its eyes burned with a fury that consumed the light around it. They said it could not be slain by steel, nor turned away by simple means.

“Wolf’s bane,” a huntsman murmured. “We found it where the beast had been. Perhaps the plant holds the key.”

Brogan listened, his lips pressed into a thin line. He had spent the night searching the woods for more of the herb, clutching at the faint hope that it might offer protection. The search had yielded little but scattered fragments of the plant, barely enough to fill a small pouch.

As the raven cried again, Brogan approached the gathered crowd, hands clasped behind his back. The villagers watched him with hollow eyes, their breaths held. They knew what this day meant. The village had long been bound to an ancient pact—a sacrifice must be made to appease the dark forces that plagued the land.

“I've found the wolf’s bane,” he muttered, “but not enough to do much more than hope.”

The village square stood solemnly as they prepared him for the ritual. A blindfold was tied around his head, a symbolic gesture more than anything else. The weight of resignation hung heavy on Brogan’s shoulders. He had saved his daughter once, two days past, when the beast came for her. Now, it seemed he would pay the price.

As they led him to the ancient stones, the crowd parted in silence, faces obscured in shadow. There was no protest, no rebellion—only the somber acceptance of their fate. A mournful air hung over the village like a thick fog.

Brogan walked without struggle, each step toward the stone altar echoing louder than the last. The stones were old, stained with the blood of previous offerings, their edges jagged and cruel. As they reached the site, the priests began to recite their chants once more, though their voices lacked the conviction needed to sway the gods.

This was not a sacrifice of choice—it was a sacrifice of necessity, of fear.

In the gray predawn, the village lay wrapped in fog, its crooked chimneys like spindly fingers scratching at the sky. Cold seeped into the bones of the men trudging out of the low huts, their breath mingling with the mist. Shadows clung to the edges of the trees, dark as if something unseen was watching. Here, in this land where nothing grew straight, nothing lived long.

Gunnar, his shoulders hunched beneath a wolfskin cloak, walked ahead of the others. His eyes were drawn to the treeline, where whispers of movement tugged at his senses. He grunted to the others but didn’t slow his pace. They had a task at hand. One that demanded haste.

“We’ll need more than wolfsbane,” muttered Brandt behind him, his voice low, as if fearing to wake something from the woods. The fog had not yet lifted from their path, and the weight of the air pressed against their skin like a warning. “A whole sack of the stuff,” he added.

Gunnar's face was hard as stone. “We’ll gather what we can. We’ll need it before the night returns.”

They moved forward, their footsteps swallowed by the soft, yielding earth beneath their boots. The land had a hunger, it seemed, a silent pull that made each step heavier than the last. Somewhere to the east, beyond the river, was the marshland. A place none dared venture without cause.

“I’ll stop by the witch,” said Gunnar. “Before we begin the raid. The iron for the manacles needs to be blessed. Else no woman or beast will be bound by it.”

Brandt shot him a glance, but said nothing. He knew well enough that Gunnar’s visit to the witch was for more than just iron. The air between them crackled with unspoken truths.

As they approached the river, the mist thinned for a moment, revealing a glimpse of what lay beyond. A sunken landscape, where twisted oaks stood like the bones of the dead, their gnarled roots exposed in the mud. The river, sluggish and black, wound through the land like a snake. Beyond that, a place forgotten by men, where whispers claimed strange things grew in the fog, and worse things walked at night.

“Down there,” said Brandt, his voice little more than a breath. “The marsh.”

Gunnar’s jaw clenched. His hand gripped the hilt of his sword. He heard it too—the faintest echo of a howl, distant and low, carried on the wind that curled from the marsh’s depths. It sounded hungry.

“There’s nothing good in that place,” he muttered. “Not for us.”

Still, they stood there for a moment, their eyes drawn to the sunken land, the strange, unnatural stillness of it. The mist had closed around it again, sealing whatever secrets it held within its grasp.

“We go in tomorrow,” Gunnar said. His voice was final. “When the sun is with us.”

They turned back, retracing their steps through the fog, though the chill never left their bones. Back to the village, where the smoke from the hearths hung in the air like the ghosts of old wars.

In the stillness, as they passed the witch’s hut, Gunnar stopped. He entered alone, leaving Brandt outside. The air inside the hut was thick with the scent of herbs and something else, darker. The witch sat by the fire, her eyes on the flames as if she had been expecting him.

“You need iron,” she rasped, not turning to look at him. Her voice was thin, like dry leaves in the wind.

“For the raid,” Gunnar said.

“And for the wife you cannot have.”

He said nothing. The witch knew more than she should. The iron manacles weren’t for any raid—they were for the woman he had taken, the one he could not keep. Not until his duty to the village was done. Until then, the chains would keep her, and the witch’s blessing would ensure no dark magic could free her.

“I must finish what I’ve begun,” Gunnar said, his voice hard. “Before I can promise myself to anyone.”

The witch smiled, a thin, cruel twist of her lips. “The land has no mercy for men like you. It takes, and it keeps.”

He left her without another word, the iron heavy in his hands, his mind darker still. Outside, Brandt waited, staring into the mist. The howl from the marsh seemed closer now, and the wind carried a hint of something foul.

“We’ll need more wolfsbane,” Brandt said as they walked.

“Aye,” Gunnar replied. “And iron. Plenty of it.”

Tomorrow, they would go to the marsh. But for now, the village slept. And something, deep in the woods, waited for them.

The fog clung to the bones of the earth like a second skin, thick and suffocating, muffling all sound but the wind’s mournful howl. The village lay in the shadow of the dark woods, brittle and silent. The beast had come and would come again. Its hunger had not been sated.

Brogan, a man hollowed by the night’s terror, stood at the edge of the town, his eyes sunken with regret. His friend, swallowed by the maw of the creature, had died in vain. The beast still prowled, and the sacrifice had failed. There was no solace in the cold, indifferent moon that hung like a judge in the sky.

A voice hissed from the shadows, low and bitter. "Oh no, it doesn't even work! Your friend... who got eaten... it was for nothing."

Brogan's fists clenched at his sides, his breath coming in ragged gasps. He knew this. He had seen the ruin, the blood in the streets. His friend’s death had been but a ripple in the pool of fate.

Another figure, lean and pale, emerged from the mist. His face was gaunt, and his eyes gleamed with a coward’s cunning. “Look at you, Brogan. You're not up to this. You've sacrificed everything, but it doesn't matter. The beast will come again, and this town will fall. But me?” He chuckled darkly. “I’ve got a rope, and I intend to survive.”

Brogan watched in silence as the man untied his escape, a flicker of rage igniting in his chest. “The wolf has to kill him,” the coward muttered under his breath, not meeting Brogan’s eyes. “But you don’t have to destroy the body. You just... you don’t want the wolf to be a beast, right?”

Brogan’s gaze turned cold. “The wolf is already a beast. I thought we were trying to save the town.”

The coward shrugged, his thin lips curling into a mockery of a smile. “I’d like to save the town, sure. But saving Brogan? Maybe not.”

Brogan’s heart beat like a war drum in his chest, but he said nothing. He felt the weight of the village’s lives on his shoulders. The weight of his own daughter’s life. Morgan.

The coward’s voice cut through the mist again. “Brogan, you’re going to die anyway. But there’s a way out. A way to save the village... and yourself. Don’t you want to be there for Morgan? Don’t you want to save her?”

Brogan's mind clouded with images of his daughter’s bright eyes, her laughter that had once filled the halls of their home. He nodded, his voice hoarse. “Of course.”

The coward smiled. “Then come. Let me bring you to your new bride.”

Brogan’s steps faltered, confusion seizing him. “What?”

But the coward took his hand, leading him through the fog, deeper into the belly of the village where the shadows were thickest. The scent of rot filled the air as they neared a hut that stood crooked and ancient, its door creaking in the wind.

The witch awaited them, her eyes burning with knowledge far older than the village itself. “You've brought the sacrifice,” she croaked, her voice rough like old parchment. “The beast will come tonight.”

Brogan’s pulse quickened, but the coward winked at the witch. “I was hoping you'd pounce on him first.”

Brogan felt the world closing in around him as the witch stepped forward, her gnarled hand reaching toward him. “This is the way to save the village,” she whispered. “You marry, you live. The beast is bound by ancient laws.”

The coward smiled again, his voice sickly sweet. “Don’t you love your daughter, Brogan? Don’t you want to save her? You wouldn’t even have to sacrifice yourself this time. You just have to marry this... charming creature.”

Brogan's heart sank, but he nodded, his soul hollow with defeat. “I’ll do it.”

The witch’s cackle pierced the night as manacles, cold as death, were clasped onto his wrists. His fate was sealed. The beast would come, and Brogan would stand as both shield and prey. He had no choice. For Morgan. For the village.

The fog thickened around them, the night growing darker, more sinister. And in the distance, the beast stirred, hungry for the blood that had been promised to it.

The sky was a bruised violet, thickened by the rolling mist that clung to the earth like a suffocating shroud. The settlement crouched low beneath the veil of fog, its narrow streets silent, as though the very ground itself was holding its breath. From the south, where the stones of the old ruined temple stood sentinel over the town, the wind carried a faint howl—something unnatural, a sound that set teeth on edge and stirred a primal fear.

Baldric and his companions huddled in the shadowed doorways of crumbling buildings, their breath fogging in the damp, chill air. They whispered hurriedly, eyes darting across the murk, haunted by the knowledge that something was hunting them. Wolf’s bane, its bitter scent sharp in the cold night, was scattered about the street—traps laid in the hope of ensnaring the beast that had terrorized the town for nights uncounted.

“We could drop more wolf’s bane here,” Baldric muttered, kneeling in the muck. His calloused hands trembled slightly as he scattered the last handful of the herb, glancing up towards the north where shadows twisted and danced through the mist. “Trap it in a small area.”

Beside him, Vaelin shook his head, the hood of his cloak pulled low over his face. “It would just fly,” he said grimly, his voice a rasp in the still air. “It’ll soar right above us, like last time. It’ll strike from the sky.”

Baldric looked down at the wolf’s bane, fingers curling into fists. “Then we lure it. I’ll hide the fact I’m wearing it.” His voice was steady, though a bead of sweat rolled down his brow. “I’ll stand in the square, draw it in. The rest of you, wait in the doorways. It’ll come for me.”

Vaelin and the others exchanged grim glances. The fog seemed to thicken around them, clinging like icy fingers. There was no better plan. There had never been. They had no choice but to act or be devoured one by one.

“I’ll bait it,” Baldric said. “When it comes for me, you know what to do.”

They crouched in their hiding places, weapons ready—Vaelin with his crossbow, Maren with her longbow strung and arrow nocked. The mist wrapped the town in an eerie silence, broken only by the occasional distant scream or the faint rustle of leaves on the wind.

And then it came.

Out of the darkness, through the dense fog, there was a rush of air—foul and cold as the breath of the grave. A shadow loomed overhead, blacker than the night itself. Its wings were vast and leathery, blotting out the faint light of the moon as it descended toward the square. The creature had the body of a wolf, but twisted and misshapen, with elongated limbs and a scaled, serpent-like tail that lashed through the air. Its head was a grotesque fusion of lizard and wolf, eyes glowing a sickly yellow, teeth long as knives.

Baldric stood alone in the center of the square, heart pounding. He could feel the beast’s gaze upon him, the weight of its hunger. With a snarl, the creature dropped from the sky, claws extended, talons gleaming in the mist.

“Now!” Baldric shouted.

Arrows whistled through the air—Vaelin’s crossbow bolt and Maren’s arrow, both aimed true. The wolf’s bane laced into the tips of their projectiles struck the beast’s hide. It roared, a sound that reverberated through the town like the howling of a thousand wolves, before crashing into the ground with a heavy thud, its limbs twitching violently.

The fog thickened even more, swirling around the creature as if it was drawing the mist into itself. Baldric stumbled back, breath caught in his throat, as the beast's eyes locked onto him one final time before fading into a shuddering, deathly silence.

The village was quiet again, but the air was thick with the stench of death and fear.
