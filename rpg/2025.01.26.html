  <h1> Doom of the Savage Kings II </h1>

  <h4> <b> Date: </b> January 26th, 2025 </h4>
  <h4> <b> Players: </b> Liam, Patrick, Peter </h4>

  <br>

  <div>

  <h4> <b> Characters </b> </h4>
  <p>
    Liam played <em> Flush </em> the Gambling Wizard.
  </p>

  <p>
    Patrick played <em>Logart</em>, the Dwarven Warrior-smith.
  </p>

  <p>
    Peter played <em>Willy</em> the Warrior.
  </p>

  <h4> <b> Chapter 1: Enter Logart </b> </h4>

  <p>
    The southern gate of Hirot loomed before the lone figure, its wooden beams darkened with age and weather, groaning softly in the wind. A single guard stood above, silhouetted against the pale sky, a hand resting warily on the hilt of his sword.
  </p>

  <p>
    "Who goes there?" the guard barked, his voice hoarse with suspicion.
  </p>

  <p>
    The traveler stepped forward, his cloak billowing behind him, and spoke with a calm, steady voice. "I am Logart".
  </p>

  <p>
    "Do you have news from the outside world?"
  </p>

  <p>
    "The towns of East and West Troy flourish," Logart replied. "But this place smells of death".
  </p>

  <p>
    The guard's eyes narrowed, but at last, he gave a slow nod. "Enter then, stranger".
  </p>

  <p>
    The air was heavy with dread as Logart stepped inside. The hovels of the village were empty, everyone gathered in the town square. In the center stood a tall, hide-clothed man — the Jarl — blindfolded, reaching into an unlatched lockbox. Beside him, an ancient seer, his gnarled frame wrapped in a tattered robe. In the crowd, Logart recognized a familiar face, the Warrior Orphan, Willy. Logart had heard rumor that the party had gone off on an adventure without him, and had followed the party to ensure they did not get into too much trouble.
  </p>

  <p>
    The lottery box, a weathered wooden chest banded with black iron, sat atop a crooked post driven into the frozen earth. A single, rusted lock sealed its lid, the key entrusted to the seer &mdash; a gaunt figure draped in shadowy robes, his face a thin mask of disdain.
  </p>

  <p>
    At the command of the Jarl, the lockbox was unlatched, and the Jarl's voice rang out. "We draw the name", he declared, and pulled forth a small slip of parchment, and handed the slip to the seer.
  </p>

  <p>
    "Timothy O'Skyan," he read, his voice a whisper of doom.
  </p>

  <p>
    A gasp rippled through the crowd. A boy — no more than ten summers — stumbled forward, his small frame trembling. He clutched his father’s hand until the man, Will O'Skyan, gently pried him loose and stepped forward.
  </p>

  <p>
    "Take me instead as sacrifice" Will said, his voice rough with grief. "The boy is but a child. He wouldn’t satiate the beast". The crowd concured, and began to bind Will's hands.
  </p>

  <p>
    "You speak of sacrifice as though it were a solution," Logart growled, stepping into the circle. "Yet I saw the scars on your houses I as I entered your town. Did not the beast attack last night? Did it not tear through your homes despite your 'offering'?"
  </p>

  <p>
    The Jarl’s jaw tightened. "Last night did not go our way. But we do what we must until the seer finds a way. The beast cannot be harmed by mortal weapons."
  </p>

  <p>
    The seer hunched lower. "Just a few more weeks to find the answer. I will find an answer within the ancient tomes of the Jarl's library. We must continue the lottery until then."
  </p>

  <p>
    From the crowd, an old priest stepped forward, wild-eyed and frantic. "We are guilty!" he cried. "The beast attacks because we drew a name not of our own blood last night — an outsider! The gods demand penance from us!" Behind him, two figures — a man and a woman — lashed their own backs with leather cords, blood dripping to the frozen earth.
  </p>

  <p>
    "Madness," Logart muttered. "You sacrifice your children while your seer scours ancient scrolls for salvation. How many more will die before you face the truth?"
  </p>

  <p>
    The Jarl's fists clenched, his knuckles white. "You know nothing of this place, outsider."
  </p>

  <p>
    Before Logart could speak again, a shout echoed through the village. Two guards ran from the Jarl’s hall, breathless.
  </p>

  <p>
    "The family rings!" one cried. "They’ve been stolen during the lottery!"
  </p>

  <p>
    The Jarl’s face darkened with fury. "Those rings are sacred — worn by the rulers of Hirot since our beginning!"
  </p>

  <p>
    Logart's lips curled into a bitter smile. "You mourn for gold while a third of your people lie in shallow graves."
  </p>

  <p>
    The village of Hirot held its breath, caught between the will of its ancient traditions and the blade of an unyielding stranger.
  </p>

  <p>
    Willy took the opportunity to speak up. "Did the beast not only come when you arrived, Seer? How do we know you're not behind this? Are you collecting sacrifices to balance some dark power?"
  </p>

  <p>
    The crowd murmured. Suspicion blossomed like a spreading stain.
  </p>

  <p>
    The Seer's face darkened. "How dare you accuse me of such wickedness? I am no necromancer!" His words struck the air, but a whisper rippled through the villagers.
  </p>

  <p>
    "You look like a necromancer," Flush muttered, who had returned from the standing stones outside the village.
  </p>

  <p>
    "I came from my meditations in the wilderness," the Seer said, his voice brittle with indignation. "I have a room at the Jarl’s mead hall. The Jarl would know if I was practicing dark arts! I am here to save Hirot — not destroy it!"
  </p>

  <p>
    Logart's voice rose, bold and biting. "You’ve been here for weeks, Seer — yet the beast still feasts! How many have died under your watch?"
  </p>

  <p>
    "We have saved all two hundred that remain here," the Seer snapped.
  </p>

  <p>
    "And lost a hundred more!" the man countered.
  </p>

  <p>
    The crowd stirred, a tide of doubt and desperation.
  </p>

  <p>
    "The beast killed those people — not I!" the Seer’s voice cracked with frustration.
  </p>

  <p>
    "You devised the lottery", the man sneered. "You pick names and call it salvation."
  </p>

  <p>
    The priest stepped forward, his robes heavy with age and burden. "The lottery is penance," he said, his voice thin as a blade of grass. "The town is guilty — guilty of some unknown sin. Only sacrifice can appease the beast and bring us mercy."
  </p>

  <p>
    "What sin has the town committed?"
  </p>

  <p>
    The priest’s eyes closed for a moment, as if listening to a distant voice. "The ways of Justicia are a mystery," he murmured. "We do not know the crime — only that repentance must be made."
  </p>

  <p>
    Willy and Logart exchanged a glance.
  </p>

  <p>
    "The seer",  whispered Willy. "He's never placed his name in the lottery. It’s his system. His design. He'll never be drawn."
  </p>

  <p>
    The other nodded, a grim line forming on his lips. "Perhaps the beast is not the only monster in Hirot."
  </p>

  <p>
    Flush clenched his gore-stained hands into a fist. "If his name isn’t in the box &mdash; that alone is injustice. We could steal the box. Rig the lottery. Slip in two hundred scraps of parchment, all bearing one name &mdash; his. Or the next drawing, we overturn the box, show the villagers. Make it clear it was never chance."
  </p>

  <p>
    The lockbox loomed over the conversation. Its surface was scarred from years of cold nights and reluctant hands.
  </p>

  <p>
    Willy's voice broke the stillness — sharp, accusing. "And will your name ever leave the box, Jarl? Or does your hand always draw the names of others?"
  </p>

  <p>
    The Jarl's jaw tightened, his fingers curling into a fist at his side. "If my name is drawn," he said, "and none volunteer in my place, then I shall meet my end as any man must. But who shall lead the village if I am gone?"
  </p>

  <p>
    Silence.
  </p>

  <p>
    Logart spat into the dirt. "How about we track the beast. The caves beyond the walls — it must lair somewhere."
  </p>

  <p>
    The Jarl shook his head. "I cannot spare more lives. My warriors guard the town, what few of them remain. If you wish to die in the woods, then go &mdash;" the Jarl said, his voice a shard of ice. "&mdash; but do not ask my warriors to follow you."
  </p>

  <p>
    After tying up Will at the standing stones, the peasants returned to the village. the mood in the tavern was grim. The Jarl's rings, symbols of his dominion and favor of the gods, had been stolen. Worse still, the thief had defiled the Jarl’s goblet — a cup of lineage and lore — with a mark of contempt more vile than blood. To desecrate such an item after all the village had suffered was a wound beyond the flesh, a scorn against their honor.
  </p>

  <p>
    Rumors of the Three Rat Gang slithered through the room as potential culprits — a gang of petty thieves in the town, who left a calling card at their crime scenes, three dead rats tied together.
  </p>

  <p>
    "Amateurs," Broegan scoffed. "They steal food. Trinkets. They wouldn't dare take anything from the Jarl’s house. This is someone else's work".
  </p>

  <h4> <b> Chapter 2 </b> </h4>

  <p>
    The party made a plan to investigate the seer. They stripped dead guards yet to be taken from the streets of their armor, hid the bodies, and donned their armor as disguises.
  </p>

  <p>
    "In order to enter the hall, we set a fire," said Flush, a figure whose face remained a shifting mask of shadow beneath his hood. "The guards will flock to the flames, and the hall will stand unguarded."
  </p>

  <p>
    "And whose house shall burn"?
  </p>

  <p>
    After a moment's silence, they chose an abandoned dilapilated dwelling. Flames leaping hungrily into the sky. Smoke spiraled upward, a beacon of false danger. "Fire! Fire!" Willy bellowed, sprinting toward the guards stationed at the hall. His voice cracked with urgency, and the men, caught in the snare of panic, gathered their buckets and fled to quell the inferno, leaving the three to enter the hall.
  </p>

  <p>
    The company hesitated at the far end of the hall — to the left lay the jarl's quarters, heavy with secrets; to the right, the unexplored depths of the keep.
  </p>

  <p>
    "We split here," said Willy. "Find evidence of the seer's treachery".
  </p>

  <p>
    The band broke apart, each warrior slipping into the gloom like a whisper on the wind. Flush found himself among the guards' barracks — a hall of iron bunks and stale air, where off-duty sentries slumbered, oblivious to the silent trespasser who slid beneath a tattered blanket, and took a nap.
  </p>






  <p>
    Fate was cruel for Willy. The door groaned open to reveal the resting place of the Thanes &mdash; unbuckling their swords and placing their helms upon wooden racks. Their gazes fell upon the intruder like the weight of a falling axe.
  </p>

  <p>
    "What is the meaning of this?" barked the eldest Thane, his beard a silver river flowing over his breastplate.
  </p>

  <p>
    "I'm here to investigate", replied Willy. "To find the stolen rings—have they been recovered?"
  </p>

  <p>
    The eldest Thane gave a grunt, and returned to ignoring Willy, who took a brief look around before leaving.
  </p>

  <p>
    Logart ventured deeper — into a neglected library. By a stone hearth, the seer slept, slumped in an armchair, his chest rising and falling in the shallow rhythm of sleep. So much for strenous research.
  </p>

  <p>
    Logart approached a desk cluttered with yellowed parchments and dusty volumes. There were no grimoires of sorcery &mdash; only the dull echoes of lineage and local legend.
  </p>

  <p>
    "The Legends of Ulfanaar", Logart whispered, his fingers tracing the title of an ancient book, stacked promisingly on the seer's desk. He slipped the tome into his satchel, a quiet trophy pried from the jaws of neglect.
  </p>

  <p>
    The seer did not stir.
  </p>

  <p>
    Willy and Logart reunited in the corridor. "Have you see Flush?", Willy said.
  </p>

  <p>
    "He went to explore, and now he's gone".
  </p>

  <p>
    "Then he has either fled or been imprisoned".
  </p>

  <p>
    The pair left the hall, before taking off their disguise. Meanwhile, Flush slept in the barracks with the other soldiers.
  </p>

  <hr>

  <p>
    A few hours later, Flush awoke, before re-donning his disguise and also leaving the hall. The three reunited at the inn.
  </p>

  <p>
    "You fool", Willy spat. "You slept among them?"
  </p>

  <p>
    Flush grinned, the reckless gleam of a man too often courting death. "Who would suspect an enemy to slumber in their own bed?"
  </p>

  <p>
    Logart's fingers whitened around his mug. "And did your boldness bear fruit? Did you hear aught of use?"
  </p>

  <p>
    Flush's smile faltered. "Only the murmurs of men lost in dreams. And you?"
  </p>

  <p>
    From beneath his cloak, Logart produced the tome he had stolen, thick and bound in cracked leather.
  </p>

  <p>
    "This book seems the most promising. I do not have time to read it all myself. Let us split the pages".
  </p>

  <p>
    With grim resolve, they untied the ancient cord binding the pages, separating the text into three parts.
  </p>

  <p>
    Hours passes, the sun dipping beneath the jagged peaks of the Trolltooth Mountains, casting long, menacing shadows over Hirot. The sky, streaked with crimson and violet, seemed to bleed as the first distant howls echoed through the hills—wolves, though none of natural birth.
  </p>

  <p>
    Within the dim confines of the inn, the adventurers pored over an ancient tome, its leather binding cracked with age, and its pages heavy with the scent of old ink and forgotten secrets. The book, The Tales of Ulfanaar, spoke of a long-dead king—an ancestor of the Jarl &mdash; whose spear, the Wolf Fang, had once bound a spirit of chaos. TODO Fix This
  </p>

  <p>
    Ulfanaar had faced the beast in those very mountains &mdash; no ordinary creature, but a wolf-thing of shadow and slaughter. It did not feast on flesh, but on suffering, growing stronger with each life it extinguished. The tribes of old had worshipped it, feeding it with blood and pain, until the king, in an act of grim resolve, drove his enchanted spear into the ground, pinning the wolf’s spirit to the earth. But the beast could not be slain by mere steel. No, it took a final act of sacrifice &mdash; Ulfanaar himself, dragging the weakened monster into the gaping maw of a great serpent, both devoured, sealing the wolf’s darkness away.
  </p>

  <p>
    Now, the adventurers whispered among themselves, their words hushed as if the creature's name might summon it from the abyss. "The spear," muttered Willy. "If it still lies within these mountains... perhaps we can bind the beast again. Let us return and speak to the Jarl about what we have found".
  </p>

  <p>
    Clad in their armor, weapons strapped tight, the company returned to the great hall. The Jarl's steward, a gaunt man with sunken eyes, met them at the entrance. "What brings you here?" he asked, though the question felt more like a plea.
  </p>

  <p>
    "We have come to uncover the truth".
  </p>

  <p>
    The steward said, but upon hearing the Jarl's words behind them, pushed open the heavy doors of the hall. The Jarl announced that the seer was open to letting the party explore the ancient tomes, in the hope of expediting salvation.
  </p>

  <p>
    The older scholar waved a hand toward the scattered tomes in the library. "These books... they speak of creatures of old, of ancient gods and beasts. Somewhere in these pages, there must be an answer. I’ve found legends &mdash; fragments of forgotten lore. They might lead us to something, but... fresh eyes might be better for it."
  </p>

  <p>
    Logart clenched his fists, pacing. "Two weeks, you said. Two weeks to find something—anything to fight the beasts. But what have we found? Words. Just words."
  </p>

  <p>
    "There is power in words," the seer murmured, her gaze never leaving the tomes. "In the old days, words could summon storms, could fell kings."
  </p>

  <p>
    "But not here," Logart growled. "Not now."
  </p>

  <p>
    Before the seer could answer, a long, mournful howl cut through the night—a sound so deep and primal it shook the very ground beneath their feet. The torches flickered violently, and for a moment, the shadows seemed to dance in grotesque shapes. The beast had drawn closer.
  </p>

  <hr>

  <p>
    The air was heavy with dread in the mead hall. Shadows flickered from the fire’s glow, casting long, dark shapes that seemed to dance and whisper at the edges of the room. The Jarl sat on this throne, gazing out a narrow window toward the mist-shrouded hills. In the distance, the faint howls of the beast echoed across the land, a reminder of the terror that gripped their souls.
  </p>

  <p>
    Willy walked over to the Jarl, interrupting his musing. "Why do you trust the seer? He claims to see, but what has he truly shown? Nothing but vague riddles and empty promises".
  </p>

  <p>
    "He has power", the Jarl replied, though even he seemed unsure. "He is our only hope."
  </p>

  <p>
    "The weapon that can bind the beast", Willy murmured. "It lies buried deep within the mountains... waiting."
  </p>

  <p>
    "The Trolltooth mountains are vast, treacherous, unforgiving. To search for the weapon in such a place is a fool’s errand."
  </p>

  <p>
    Willy changed tactics. "I heard that a witch lives in this town, untouched by the beast’s wrath. They say she possesses magic that can protect from the beast."
  </p>

  <p>
    "A witch?" the Jarl scoffed. "Superstitious nonsense."
  </p>

  <p>
    "Not nonsense. She can help. But there’s a price. She will only help if... if someone marries her. If you marry her... you might save the town."
  </p>

  <p>
    "I will not marry a witch", the Jarl said quietly, his tone resolute.
  </p>

  <p>
    "Better to marry a witch than let your people be slaughtered like lambs. Or do you care so little for your village?"
  </p>

  <p>
    The Jarl stiffened, his eyes narrowing. "You think so lightly of marriage? You’re a fool, Willy. You've seen the superstition of the villagers here. They would never let their leader marry a witch".
  </p>

  <p>
    "And yet the choice remains. The witch’s magic or the beast’s fangs."
  </p>

  <p>
    "I will not marry her," Galdric repeated.
  </p>

  <p>
    "What then?" Willy growled. "Shall we send more to die tomorrow? Shall we cower while the beast rips your kin apart?"
  </p>

  <p>
    The Jarl grunted, his eyes fixed on the dark horizon. The wolf howled out again in the distance.
  </p>

  <p>
    Behind us, a voice broke the quiet. The seer approached. "It is time for our evening walk, Jarl".
  </p>

  <p>
    "Let me join you," Logart called, his voice echoing in the night. He stepped forward, his cloak fluttering like a raven's wing. "Surely, you promised the town more transparency."
  </p>

  <p>
    The Jarl's face hardened beneath his thick beard. His hand moved, as if to wave the stranger away, but I placed my palm on his arm, stilling him. "You are not of this village," I said coldly. "You do not understand the dangers we face."
  </p>

  <p>
    The man’s eyes flickered with something unreadable. "Then why not let someone from the village join you?" he pressed.
  </p>

  <p>
    I turned, my gaze sweeping over the silent houses, the flickering lanterns hanging by the doors. "This is not a matter for many ears."
  </p>

  <p>
    The Jarl exhaled, a deep sound of frustration, but before he could speak, another figure approached from the shadows. Flush stepped into the pale light of the moon, dressed in guard's clothing.
  </p>

  <p>
    "I will accompany you", Flush said. "The town could be dangerous at night if the wolf attacks."
  </p>

  <p>
    The Jarl nodded. "Very well. Watch our backs."
  </p>

  <p>
    And so the Jarl, the Seer, and Flush walked through the village in silence, the Jarl ocassionally hunching over to listen to the Seer, who whispered into his ear, low and cautious. The wind whispered through the trees around Hirot. Flush remained a few paces behind.
  </p>

  <p>
    The three stopped at the town square, where the lockbox sat &mdash; an ancient chest bound in iron, holding the village’s most valuable secrets. The Jarl took the lockbox key from the Seer's neck, and went to the lockbox. He stayed beside it for some time, opening the box and inspecting inside, before returning. "The lockbox is secure".
  </p>

  <p>
    Flush’s eyes narrowed. Why did the Jarl need to open the box to ensure the lockbox was secure?
  </p>

  <p>
    "We should return," the Jarl said, his voice low and heavy with the weight of command. "The night is not yet over, and the beast is out on prowl.
  </p>

  <h4> <b> Chapter 3 </b> </h4>

  <p>
    While Flush was out with the Jarl and the Seer, Willy and Logart returned to the hovel of the Mad Widow Ymae. Inside, the fire's glow flickered, casting strange shadows in the dim room as the widow Ymae sat in her dark corner. Her gaunt, wrinkled hands moved with unsettling precision, knitting thread pulled from the flames themselves. The fire’s golden threads spiraled around her fingers, weaved into a strange garment, a jumper of shimmering light that flickered in the cold air. The crackling of the fire seemed to mirror her dry, brittle voice when she spoke, her eyes, clouded with the passage of years, glimmering with ancient knowledge.
  </p>

  <p>
    "You’ve been busy, haven’t you?" she whispered, barely glancing up from her endless task. "Learning more about the town’s secrets... the legends." Her tone was laced with bitter amusement, the hint of a smile tugging at her cracked lips. "I’ve heard the whispers in the walls."
  </p>

  <p>
    The figure before her shifted uneasily, caught between the warmth of the fire and the ice in the old woman’s gaze.
  </p>

  <p>
    Ymae chuckled darkly, her laugh more like the hiss of dying embers. "Oh, Patrick’s doing well," she said, her voice lilting with mock affection. "Sleeping over there in my bed. He’d make a fine husband, wouldn’t he? Strong, quiet... a sense of duty. What more could a woman ask for in her twilight years? He reminds me of my first husband," she mused. Strong, Beautiful, Callous... but not as clever as he thought."
  </p>

  <p>
    Her knitting needles clacked together, each stroke of thread a heartbeat in the otherwise still night. The person standing before her watched in morbid fascination as the golden threads continued to spin from the fire, shaped by her withered fingers into something unnatural, something that seemed to pulse with a life of its own.
  </p>

  <p>
    "Why do you come here so late?" she asked suddenly, her voice sharp and cutting through the silence.
  </p>

  <p>
    "I’ve been thinking about your offer," Willy replied, hesitant. "The protections... you said you could help. We will promise you Patrick's hand in marriage if you help us weave fetters to bind the beast."
  </p>

  <p>
    Ymae’s smile widened, her lips stretching too far over yellowed teeth. "Then bring me the hair of the dead," she said finally, her voice low and menacing. "and I will weave you the manacles you need. If you bring it, I will have protections ready before the next moonrise."
  </p>

  <p>
    The air seemed to thicken, the fire’s glow dimming as the words hung in the air like a curse. The widow resumed her knitting, the sound of the needles like bones rattling in a grave.
  </p>

  <hr>

  <p>
    Outside, the night pressed in, thick with unseen eyes and lurking dangers. The moon hung low, casting its pale light over the land. The journey to the crematorium was long, and the shadows stretched across the path, twisting and curling like the fingers of long-dead things. Three guards stood vigil at the gates, their eyes gleaming in the torchlight.
  </p>

  <p>
    "Who goes there?" one called, his voice hard like iron. "What business do you have with the dead at this hour?"
  </p>

  <p>
    Willy hesitated steeling himself. "I come at the seer’s bidding," they answered. "He told me to examine the bodies... to search for signs."
  </p>

  <p>
    The guards exchanged glances, wary. "At this hour?" one scoffed, eyeing the stranger with suspicion. "The dead are at rest. Come back in the morning if the seer wishes to meddle with corpses."
  </p>

  <p>
    Logart pressed, their voice steady. "The seer said it must be done tonight. There is no time to wait."
  </p>

  <p>
    The guards’ expressions hardened, but they stepped aside reluctantly. "Do what you must", one muttered, his eyes lingering on the shadowy figure as they passed. "But be quick about it. The dead don’t like to be disturbed."
  </p>

  <p>
    With careful hands, Logart and Willy cut strands of hair from the corpses, their fingers trembling as they worked.
  </p>

  <p>
    By the time the moon sank low and the horizon began to pale, the two returned to Ymae’s house, the hair of the dead clutched tight in their hands. The widow was waiting, her knitting complete, the jumper of golden thread folded neatly on her lap.
  </p>

  <p>
    "Good," she whispered, her eyes gleaming with dark satisfaction. "Now the weaving can begin."
  </p>

  <p>
    And with that, the fire burned brighter, its flames rising high, casting the room in an eerie light as the widow began her dark work once more.
  </p>

  <h4> <b> Chapter 4 </b> </h4>

  <p>
    In the pallor of dawn, the village lay shrouded beneath a veil of mist, its bleak stones and thatched rooftops appearing as little more than ghostly silhouettes against the grey morning. A raven's call pierced the silence as a crowd gathered for the morning lottery. The Jarl drew lots, and Broegan's name was elected for the sacrifice.
  </p>

  <p>
    The village square stood solemnly as they prepared him for sacrifice. The weight of resignation hung heavy on Brogan’s shoulders. His daughter had been saved. Now, it seemed he would pay the price.
  </p>

  <p>
    They led him to the ancient stones, and then the crowd parted in silence.
  </p>

  <hr>

  <p>
    Willy, his shoulders hunched beneath a wolfskin cloak, walked in the woods They had a task at hand. One that demanded haste.
  </p>

  <p>
    "We’ll need more than just a couple bunches of wolfsbane," muttered Flush behind him. The fog had not yet lifted from their path, and the weight of the air pressed against their skin like a warning. "A whole sack of the stuff," he added. "We should dress our armor in it, our weapons, everything".
  </p>

  <p>
    Willy's face was hard as stone. "We’ll gather what we can. We’ll need it before the night returns."
  </p>

  <p>
    They moved forward, their footsteps swallowed by the soft, yielding earth beneath their boots. They reached a clearing at the river. As they approached the river, the mist thinned for a moment, revealing a glimpse of what lay beyond. A sunken landscape, where twisted oaks stood like the bones of the dead, their gnarled roots exposed in the mud. The river, sluggish and black, wound through the land like a snake. Beyond that, a place forgotten by men, where whispers claimed strange things grew in the fog, and worse things walked at night.
  </p>

  <p>
    "Down there," said Logart, pointing. "The marsh."
  </p>

  <p>
    Willy’s jaw clenched. His hand gripped the hilt of his sword. He heard it too &mdash; the faintest echo of a howl, distant and low, carried on the wind that curled from the marsh’s depths. It sounded hungry.
  </p>

  <p>
    "There’s nothing good in that place," he muttered. "Not for us."
  </p>

  <p>
    Still, they stood there for a moment, their eyes drawn to the sunken land, the strange, unnatural stillness of it. The mist had closed around it again, sealing whatever secrets it held within its grasp.
  </p>

  <p>
    They turned back, retracing their steps through the fog, though the chill never left their bones. On the way back, Flush had an idea. "Let's make a detour to the standing stones. Perhaps we can find another husband for the mad witch".
  </p>

  <hr>

  <p>
    Broegan, lay strapped on the standing stones. He tried to stay calm, but there was no solace in the cold.
  </p>

  <p>
    Flush emerged from the mist. "Look at you, Broegan. You're not up to this. You've sacrificed everything, but it doesn't matter. The beast will come again, and this town will fall. But we have a plan to survive."
  </p>

  <p>
    Brogan watched as the man untied his lashes. When his mouth was unmuffled, he pleaded: "Please, leave me tied up. I do not have the courage to face the beast by will alone".
  </p>

  <p>
    Willy also emerged from the mist. "Broegan, this town will die without a better solution. But we have a way out. A way to save the village... and yourself. Don’t you want to be there for Morgan?"
  </p>

  <p>
    Brogan's mind clouded with images of his daughter’s bright eyes, her laughter that had once filled the halls of their home. He nodded, his voice hoarse. "Of course."
  </p>

  <p>
    The coward smiled. "Then come. Let me bring you to your new bride."
  </p>

  <p>
    Broegan’s steps faltered, confusion seizing him. "What?"
  </p>

  <p>
    The trio took Broegan's hand, leading him through the fog, and snuck him back into the village over a side wall, toward the lone hut that stood crooked and ancient on the village side.
  </p>

  <p>
    The witch awaited them, her eyes burning with knowledge far older than the village itself. Willy spoke out: "This man is willing to marry you instead of Patrick".
  </p>

  <p>
    Broegan felt the world closing in around him as the witch stepped forward, her gnarled hand reaching toward him. "Yes, he has good teeth", she paused.
  </p>

  <p>
    Willy reassured Broegan: "This is the way to save the village," he whispered. "If you marry her, then the town lives". Don’t you love your daughter, Brogan? Don’t you want to save her? You wouldn’t even have to sacrifice yourself this time. You just have to marry this... charming creature."
  </p>

  <p>
    Brogan's heart sank, but he nodded, his soul hollow with defeat. "I’ll do it."
  </p>

  <p>
    The witch’s cackle pierced the night as manacles, cold as death, were clasped onto his wrists. His fate was sealed.
  </p>

  <h4> <b> Chapter 4 </b> </h4>

  <p>
    The fog thickened around the party as the night grew closer. In the distance, the beast stirred, seeking the standing stones for blood that had been promised to it.
  </p>

  <p>
    The party huddled in the shadowed doorways of crumbling buildings, their breath fogging in the damp, chill air. They whispered hurriedly, eyes darting across the murk, haunted by the knowledge that something was hunting them. Wolf’s bane, its bitter scent sharp in the cold night.
  </p>

  <p>
    "We could drop more wolf’s bane around here," Logart muttered, kneeling in the muck. His calloused hands trembled slightly as he scattered the last handful of the herb, glancing up towards the north where shadows twisted and danced through the mist. "Trap it in a small area."
  </p>

  <p>
    Beside him, Flush shook his head, the hood of his cloak pulled low over his face. "It would just fly away", he said grimly, his voice a rasp in the still air. "It strikes from the sky."
  </p>

  <p>
    Logart looked down at the wolf’s bane, fingers curling into fists. "Then we lure it. I’ll hide the fact I’m wearing it." His voice was steady, though a bead of sweat rolled down his brow. "I’ll stand in the square, draw it in. The rest of you, wait in the doorways. When it comes for me, you know what to do."
  </p> 

  <p>
    They crouched in their hiding places, crossbows ready. The mist wrapped the town in an eerie silence, broken only by the occasional howl, or the faint rustle of leaves on the wind.
  </p>

  <p>
    And then it came.
  </p>

  <p>
    Out of the darkness, through the dense fog, there was a rush of air &mdsh; foul and cold as the breath of the grave. A shadow loomed overhead, blacker than the night itself. Its wings were vast and leathery, blotting out the faint light of the moon as it descended toward the square. The creature had the body of a wolf, but twisted and misshapen, with elongated limbs and a scaled, serpent-like tail that lashed through the air. Its head was a grotesque fusion of lizard and wolf, eyes glowing a sickly yellow, teeth long as knives.
  </p>

  <p>
    Logart stood alone in the center of the square, heart pounding. He could feel the beast’s gaze upon him, the weight of its hunger. With a snarl, the creature dropped from the sky, claws extended, talons gleaming in the mist.
  </p>

  <p>
    "Now!" Logart shouted.
  </p>

  <p>
    Arrows whistled through the air &mdash; Flush’s crossbow bolt and Willy’s arrow, both aimed true. The beast roared, a sound that reverberated through the town like the howling of a thousand wolves. Logart stumbled back, breath caught in it's throat, as the beast's serpentine eyes locked onto his own.
