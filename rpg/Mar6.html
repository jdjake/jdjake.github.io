    <h1> Secrets of the Shoreline </h1>

  <h4> <b> Date: </b> March 6th, 2024 </h4>
  <h4> <b> Players: </b> Abe, Dan, Hugh, Parash </h4>

  <br>

  <div>

  <h4> <b> Characters </b> </h4>
  <p>
    Abe played <em>Bep 'Gunpowder' Glover</em>, a Jesuit Monk based on the isle of Yuma. Known for his stench, the rotten teeth hanging out of his mouth, and his preference for alchohol.
  </p>
  <p>
    Dan played <em>Iago ‘Le Red Bird’</em>, a backstabbing rapscallion, a sailor with an insatiable urge for treasure. His previous adventures lead him to a narrow escape from a cannibalistic ending, but he never escaped <em>that smell</em>.
  </p>
  <p>
    Hugh played <em> Low Roller </em>, a swashbuckler who concealed a mysterious past as a barkeep with a liking for mocking banter amongst the other crewmates. There was <em>something contagious</em> about him.
  </p>
  <p>
    Parash played <em>Eva 'Two Toes' Martinez</em>, a Rotund wig-wearing Buccaneer. Marooned after a failed mutinee aboard the Portugeuse navy, Eva picked himself up and had been running some odd jobs to make a name for himself in the free ports of the Carribean.
  </p>

  <h4> <b> Confrontation in the Canopy </b> </h4>

  <p>
    The gang failed their attempt to sneak up to the voices ahead of them, branches snapping loudly beneath their feet, warning their quarry of their approach.
  </p>

  <p>
    They heard a guttural, meacing voice percing the silence ahead of them:
  </p>

  <p style="margin-left: 25px;">
    <em> Who goes there?! More fishmen? We'll gut you like we did the rest of your kind. </em>
  </p>

  <p>
    A sterner, more authoritive voice interjected:
  </p>

  <p style="margin-left: 25px;">
    <em> Silence! I sense something else... </em>
  </p>

  <p>
    After a long, focused, piercing sniff into the darkness, the voice continued:
  </p>

  <p style="margin-left: 25px;">
    <em> Yes... ...like the one who was touched... </em>
  </p>

  <p style="margin-left: 25px;">
    <em> You believe you can skulk from us in the shadows. We are kin to all that thrives in the depths of darkness. Your mere presence taints the sanctity of this freshly consecrated isle. Reveal yourselves, or be devoured by the horrors lurking beneath the veil. </em>
  </p>

  <p>
    The players, somewhat intimidated by the threats, stumbled into a dimly lit clearing ahead of them. Awaiting them were a small group of enigmatic figures, standing at alert. Their silhouette's were illuminated by the flickering glow of a small fire behind them, itself constructed underneath a 15 foot, curved stela carved with glyphs and pictograms. Their attire, befitting sailors from distant shores, were stained wine-dark with some ink or dye, adorned with peculiar trinkets that glinted in the firelight. The smell of seaweed and bracken wood permeated the stagnant jungle air around them.
  </p>

  <p>
    The same authoritative voice, a woman, seemingly the leader of the group, continued:
  </p>

  <p style="margin-left: 25px;">
    <em> What wretched souls reveal themselves. You reek of uncertainty and trepidation. What purpose have you here, trespassing on forsaken ground. </em>
  </p>

  <p>
    Sensing the cultish nature of speech, Abe's mind raced with thoughts of infernal dealings he might have encountered in his studies of scriptures. He felt there was no devilish work afoot here, but something deeper, older, and more primal at play here.
  </p>

  <p>
    Attempting to decieve the woman, Iago spoke of their alleigance to the Dark Gods, and spoke of knowledge the gang had that might help them find what they searched for. But his words fell on death ears.
  </p>

  <p  style="margin-left: 25px;">
    <em> No. Your feeble minds fail to grasp the mysteries at play here. Flee now, or we'll make of you what we made the other inhabitants of this island. </em>
  </p>

  <p>
    As tensions escalated, the gang readied their weapons, bracing for inevitable confrontation. The woman continued:
  </p>

  <p  style="margin-left: 25px;">
    <em> I tire of this. I cannot be distrated from my purpose. Bind them! </em>
  </p>

  <p>
    In a flurry of movement, the woman ran off, three of her followers following. Two figures remained. Sensing danger, the gang scattered into the dark of the jungle behind them. The figures followed, beginning to chant some dark incantations; their voices spoke an unnatural language, coming out muffled and distorted, refracted and scattered as if being heard underwater.
  </p>

  <p>
    Abe immediately felt the consequence of this chanting. His breath was stolen away, suddenly feeling a suffocating presence in his lungs. He retched forward, foul smelling bilgewater pouring from his airways. But however much he retched, this didn't alleviate the suffocating symptoms he was feeling.
  </p>

  <p>
    Iago and Eva responded swiftly, their muskets unleashing thunderous echoes into the kanopy, taking down one of the figures. Even as the life faded from his fallen comrade, the other figure remained oblivious, continuing to chant, lost in a trance-like state.
  </p>

  <p>
    Low Roller, noticing the figure in a trance, took the opportunity to sneak up to the other figure. Despite an unnatural strength that seemed to keep the cultist's jaw open, Low Roller managed to clamp the cultist's jaw down, silencing their incantations, and granting a momentary relief to Abe. 
  </p>

  <h4> <b> Tracking In the Shadows </b> </h4>

  <p>
    As the conjurer returned from his trance like state, Low Roller held a gleaming knife to their throat, promising swift retribution should they dare to resume their chanting.
  </p>

  <p>
    Under threat of death, the cultist relented, divulging the woman's plan to retrieve the meteorite they were searching for from a crash site to the east. Having got what they needed, Low Roller cut the throat of the cultist, who fell with a thud to the floor.
  </p>

  <p>
    Guided by Eva's navigation skills, the group tracked the leader of the group, following the broken vegetation, footprints, and the telltale smell of the cultists that marked their path. After several horus of tracking, they emerged onto a sandy beachfront under the dying light of the sun setting behind them.
  </p>

  <p>
    Noone awaited them. But carved into the shoreline was a gaping tunnel, blasted into the sand, the outer contours of the tunnel melted down into gnarled crusts of glass.
  </p>

  <p>
    Hearing grunting coming from deep inside of the tunnel, the group decided to plan an ambush in case they had to flee the tunnel in a hurry. Using what remained from the bucket of pitch tar they'd been using to track their path through the jungle, they poured tar over the entrance fo the tunnel. Eva decided to keep watch, while the other three descended into the cavern.
  </p>

  <p>
    The tunnel, almost perfectly circular in diameter, went at least 30 metres deep, the diameter narrowing from a path wide enough to walk into a crawlspace, and then eventually widening again into a large, cathedral sized cavern. Hearing the call of nature, Bep took to the side of the cavern to take a piss, while the rest of them proceeded into the cavern, some large stalagmites provided natural cover for the group to survey the room. Illuminated with an eerie, pulsating, overworldly emerald glow from below, causing the cavern to come alive with shadows.
  </p>

  <p>
    The group saw a familiar woman, together with her assistants she'd taken from the campsite, who were overseeing the backbreaking work of a group of four grizzled, bearded men, wearing clothing similar to the others from the group. With rope, they were trying to pull a dinghy from the lower parts of the cavern, which contained a perfectly spherical, about the size of a human head, and from which the emerald light was pulsating from. Finding it difficult to get close to the dinghy without alerting the cultists, the group decided to taunt the group into the ambush they'd setup above the cave.
  </p>

  <p>
    Meanwhile, Eva kept vigilant watch over the beach, his senses attuned to the growing shadows around him as night approached. Amidst the darkness of the jungle, Eva seemed to feel a solitary eye watching him from afar. He decided to keep watch, bracing himself in case of an ambush.
  </p>

  <p>
    After launching a barrage of shots from their vantage point behind the stalagmites, the group rushed out of the cave, pursued by the cultists behind them. Amidst the chaos, the cultists had missed Bep peeing behind one of the stalagmites. Seizing the opportunity, Bep snuck behind the cultists, taking some backstabs at the cultists, before dashing past the cultists, joining the rest of his companions out of range of the tar that saturated the entrance of the tunnel.
  </p>

  <p>
    With a thunderous cry, Low Roller rallied his comrades, using the flintlock mechanism of his pistol to ignite the tar, his fingers slightly singed by the growing flames as he pulled back from the tar. The old, fatigued men of the group quickly succumbed to the fire, but the younger acolytes, perhaps possessed by some eldritch energy, stood resolute for some time more. They spoke dark incantations that reverberated through Bep's mind, twisting and distorting his thoughts into a maelstrom of confusion and agony. His consciousness slipped away, and he fell lifeless into the sand. In the midst of the chaos, Low Roller grabbed ahold the injured leader of the group, pulling her out of the fire. The gang stood victorious, amidst the crackle of flames and smoke emerging from the tunnel entrance.
