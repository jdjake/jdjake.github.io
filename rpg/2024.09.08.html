  <p>
    Peter played <em> Mickey </em> the Halfling Money Lender, <em> Johnson </em> the Jester, <em> Willy </em> the Orphan, and <em> Chad </em> the Guild Beggar.
  </p>

  <h4> <b> Part 1: Exploring the Courtyard </b> </h4>

  <p>
    Regrouping in the blood stained courtyard, the party assessed their surroundings. Nearly all the buildings around them had fallen to ruin, except a burnt out shell of a building set against the keep's east wall.
  </p>

  <p>
    Johnson and Mickey, hoping to learn more about the workings of the dark well in the courtyard, took the corpse of Gouda Cheddar and lofted it over the coping of the well, while Bones Mcgee stared below with the mirror. The body fell into the well, but seemed to hang in place eerily, as the body's proportions began to stretch and squish into odd proportions. Confirming Bones' suspicions, the group decided to move on to other parts of the keep.
  </p>

  <p>
    Next, the group decided to look at the charred back building on the eastern side of the courtyard. Fire-scarred stone walls and toad-faced gargoyles leered from above. The singed bronze doors, cast with hundreds of wailing demonic faces, were barred from the outside, and a single word is marked in flaking red paint: REPENT.
  </p>

  <p>
    It was a simple matter to open the bronze doors from the outside by lifting a latch, causing a waft of heat to burst through the opening, the smell of freshly burnt incense and charred flesh filling the party's nostrils. Inside, charred skeletons littered the aisles between pews in what must have been some sort of chapel. At the front of the building a squat, demonic stone toad sat atop a fountaion, a foul, black ichor seeping from it's broad lips, pooling in a basin at the foot of the fountain.
  </p>

  <p>
    Paracelcus decided to approach the fountain while the others cowered behind the entrance door. As they got closer, the toad's eye seemed to glint in front of them. The heat was clearly coming from the statue. Closer still, they saw the eyes were made of red gemstones, and the fangs blue sapphires. As the reached to grab the gems, the ichor quickened, pooling out of the basin as opaque black pseudopods reached to grab Paracelcus. The group ran into the chapel and quickly saved Paracelcus, then looted the chapel, finding some blackened weapons and armor, and an iron coffer containing cones of incense and a golden censer.
  </p>

  <h4> <b> Part 2: Into The Darkness </b> </h4>

  <p>
    Having explored the remainder of the courtyard, the group decided to venture into the spiral tower again. Above the spiral staircase, they found the mechanism that had slammed the gate shut on Johnson, sealing them in the keep. Below the rotting rugs where they'd encountered the beastmen, they found a trapdoor concealing a ladder going 10 feet into darkness.
  </p>

  <p>
    Haydee was the first down. Waiting for the others, he surveyed the broad stone steps descending into darkness. A hint of gold glimmered in the corner of his eye, and Haydee reached down. Three gold coins lay on the gray stone step. Reaching down to stash the coins from the rest of the party, Haydee also noticed a crack in the wall, which pulled back to reveal a door painted to conceal itself in the wall. Haydee called over the rest of the party, and Haydee and Bones Mcgee went through the narrow doorway.
  </p>

  <p>
    This secret room was small and narrow, lined with cut stone blocks. Dusty cobwebs hung from the low ceiling. A trio of chests laid upended in the corners at the rear of the chamber amid a scattering of odd coins. Investigating the vault for traps, Haydee noticed that the floor of one of the chests was 4 inches higher than the others. Bones reached in, finding a false panel on the edge of the chest which slipped back into the chest's bottom. Unfortunately, the motion caused a 'click', and a slim slicing blade was launched across the rim of the false panel, slicing two fingers off and severing an artery. Underneath lay a valuable prize - two silver rings set with emeralds, a silk tabard stiched with the sigil of chaos, and a steel vial containing two doses of what Paracelcus was able to identify as the oil of the Black Lotus. This oil is toxic to humans though releases an inner strength when ingested.
  </p>

  <p>
    The party left the hidden chamber, and descended down the wide stone steps descending into darkness. Eventually, they reached a long humid hall, centered around a long brackish twenty foot pool. The walls were decorated with elaborate tile mosaics, depicting foul ceremonies worshiping dark fiends. The party felt these slick mosaics for secret doors, lined with condensation and black algae running in rivulets and collecting in the pool below. In each corner of the room lay four nooks from which hung mold-eaten hooded robes, embroidered with bizarre sigils in silver thread. Haydee was lead to investigate the pool. Looking in, he noticed that deep within lay hundreds of skulls. One on the side seemed to call to him, and he reached deep into the pool and picked out the skull, which he stashed away.
  </p>

  <h4> <b> Part 3: The Starless Sea </b> </h4>

  <p>
    Wide stone steps descended to a beach of black sand stretching out before a vast underground sea, the sand churned with hundreds of footprints, talons, and hooves. A lone standing stone stands towering over the shoreline, with narrow steps winding around the pinnacle. Illuminated with a golden glow, a dragon-prowed longship emerges from the darkness, it's hull scrawled with forbidding sigils and runes that glow a sickly green, stopping about fifty feet from the shoreline. Amidst the quiet lapping of the waves, the party could hear the distant beat of drums and wails of terror.
  </p>

  <p>
    Haydee decided to investigate the monolith. It's surface was carved in mesmerizing swirls. Somehow, the swirls made sense to Haydee, and he came to a grim but zealous realization. The menhir was a sacrificial stone to the Great Leviathan that prowled the waters below, and a heart must be offered. Haydee lunged at Paracelcus. Fortunately, Wayne came to the rescue, rastling Haydee to the ground with rope.
  </p>

  <p>
    Avoiding looking at the swirls on the monolith, Chad climbed the narrow staircase around the tower. At the pinnacle, a shallow stone bowl is cut in the centre of the monolith, filled with old, red, hardened wax, a dried out stub sitting atop the mound. The wax was lit, and the dragon boat began drawing itself to the shore.
  </p>

  <p>
    The party boarded the ship, Haydee coming out of a daze and coming back to a grim realization of what they'd attempted to do. The golden glow which illuminated the dragon boat came from behind, through the gloom ahead of them, which the dragon boat began gliding towards. But after a hundred feet of sailing, two great tentacles wrapped themselves around the stern, a third rising up threateningly out of the water.
  </p>

  <p>
    The group decided to try fighting off the beast, as members of the party were grabbed and swept out of the boat by the three tentacles, but were unable to make much of an impact, several members of the party dying in the fight, other being swept into the water. As a last resort, Haydee decided to hack out the heart of, who floated unconscious in the water, and thrust out his hand holding the heart, still beating, to the leviathan. The creature grasped the heart, and then retreated back into the deep.
  </p>

  <p>
    The party pulled themselves back aboard the boat, which continued floating onward. The golden glow grew closer, until the source was clear: a towering ziggurat, with burning light radiating from within silver-thin cracks between it's massive stone blocks. A large staircase sloped upward to the top of the temple, filled with hordes of beastmen, howling to the darkness, hammering on massive hide drums and pushing a terrified throng of chained prisoners upward towards the ziggurat's glowing peak. High atop the temple, you make out a fearsome sillhouette of a huge armored figure, wreathed in an infernal smoke lit from below. Below a beastman with a gnarled staff lead the procession, whipping up the crowd into a frenzied chant.
  </p>

  <p>
    Willy called out to the beastman at the top of the ziggurat, who turned briefly to acknowledge them, before sending four of its followers down to subdue the party, and add them to the line of prisoners being lead to the peak. Perhaps underestimating the group, the four beastmen were killed. Some of the group donned the robes they'd found in a previous chamber, which caused the beastmen to cower away in fear. Meanwhile, Haydee felt the skull tugging at his pocket, and was lead past the party up to the top of the ziggurat. Fortunately most of the beastmen among the ziggurat were enraptured by whatever foul ritual were conducting, and he was able to sneak into the line of prisoners, some of whom he recognized from the village.
  </p>

  <p>
    The tug of the skull lead to the ziggurat's peak. Through the smoke, Haydee was able to make out that the huge armored figure was actually a wicker effigy of an armored figure, with a wicker helmet knotted with ram-like horns over a vast, smoking pit glowing with hellish light. The skull pulled towards the effigy, as the staff-wielding shaman hoists the wicker effigy into the pit, while a trio of snarling beastmen upended woven baskets into the pit, pouring thousands of coins in, producing gouts of hissing steam and smoke.
  </p>

  <p>
    As the human sacrifices draw near, the shaman howls to the darkness above, and pitches the effigy into the pit. All flames are extinguished, plunging the cavern into darkness, as a great moment of silence passes over the beastmen. Then out of the darkness, the effigy bursts again into flame, gold-steeped magma being drawn magically upwards and filling the wicker structure and beginning to animate the effigy.
  </p>

  <p>
    Haydee's skull flared bright with hatred, and he threw it as the wicker structure as it began to animate. The skull shattered on impact, erupting into flame. Meanwhile, the robe wearers had reached the summit, where they prepared to destroy the effigy before the ritual could be completed.
  </p>

  <p>
    The magma inside the wicker began to harden, rapidly cooling to a blackened form. Then the rock crust shattered, revealing the fully-armored body of a hellish, horned humanoid, with a single, cyclopean eye blazing with infernal light, ready for battle with a triple-headed spiked flail.
  </p>

  <p>
    A fierce battle ensued, but the party had caught the ritual with surprise, and they concentrated on breaking apart the effigy before the ritual could be completed. Perhaps weakened by the incompletion of the ritual, the peasants somehow managed to defeat the summoned monster. It began to dissolve back into magma, it's flail and demon armor falling to the ground with a great thud that causes a low rumble to roll through the cavern, building to a deafening roar. Massive stone slabs begin to peel from the ceiling of the cavern, and fall into the sea. Cracks begin to form in the ziggurat's floor, as the sizzling magma that came from the great horned one sizzles back beneath the cracks.
  </p>

  <p>
    The beastmen, realizing their ritual had failed, began to flee in any direction they could, running into the waters. Grabbing what treasures they could find, the party ran back towards the dragon boat, as from the darkness a towering, 30 foot wave began to grow from the shore they came from, heading for the ziggurat.
  </p>

  <p>
    Some tried to find a place to shield themselves from the waters, while others decided to trust the dragon boat to carry them through the roaring wave coming for them. Those that boarded the dragon boat were rewarded, as the towering wave propelled the party with terrifying speed over the crumbling ziggurat. In the darkness, a distant cavern wall began to grow closer, which the boat hurtled towards at a frightening speed. But fortune favored the party &mdash; Through a sea of towering whitecaps and the debris of falling boulders, a narrow cave mouth became visible in thw wall. The dragon-prowed ship rode the crest of the wave and shot into the rocky maw, the howling surf crashing around, and into the darkness beyond.
