    <h1> Prequel: Conspiracies at Coral Town </h1>

  <h4> <b> Date: </b> April 23rd, 2024 </h4>
  <h4> <b> Players: </b> Avi, Gary </h4>

  <br>

  <div>

  <h4> <b> Characters </b> </h4>
  <p>
    Gary played <em>Annemicke 'Flatline' Hollegate</em>, a known pirate and heretic amongst the colonial powers of the Caribbean. He'd gained a knack for wilderness survival, even if it'd cost him his right eye in the process.
  </p>
  <p>
    Avi played <em>'Stuttering' Sam</em>, a hideously ugly, annoyingly religion rapscallion with a haunted past. He joined the gang in Port Fortune; he knew Annemicke from when they were pirates about Captain Cabbagehead's Ship, 'The Queen Isabella's Malice'
  </p>

  <h4> <b> BLAH </b> </h4>

  <ul>
    <li> Your crew landed your boat, the Queen Isabella’s Malice, a Frigate stolen from the Spanish fleet, in the ports of Coral Town, in Black Coral Bay, on the Western side of the Salamander Isles, on the morn’ of the Feast of the Saltwater Squid. Captain Cabbagehead gave you leave to relax for the day while the ship was repaired and supplies were replenished. </li>

    <li> You noticed an abnormal number of pirate ships docked, given that Black Coral Bay is governed by the oppressive conquistador Don La Serpiente, who cracks down hard on pirates, and is known to torture. </li>

    <li> You talked to Jack, a crewmember of The Gilded Raven, who’d heard gossip from another crewmember, Charlie Pisspot, that the Governer, a subordinate of the Baron, was looking to usurp Don la Serpiente, and he’d be willing to pardon you all for the crime (and let you take what loot you could find in the castle) in exchange for helping him. </li>

    <li> You talked to the other ships docked, and made allies with Jack from The Gilded Raven, Morgana Bloodtide of The Tyrant, French Marie of the Storm’s End, and made potential rivals with Jamaica Edwards of The Royal Dragon, who was paying off the general public to help him raid the fort. </li>

    <li> You went down to the town square, got some squid, and scoped out the festival. Governor gave a speech to much applause about how the town’s fortunes would turn around this very night, while a young woman looked bored to pieces on the sidelines. Avi went into the Curio Emporium, where he avoided getting swindled and got hold of a weapon for the evening. </li>

    <li> You rounded up some guards and went to the Treasured Chest, owned by Peter Treasure, where Gary drunk the guards under the table (but got a little drunk himself - Minus 2 Agility), whereas Avi feigned drinking with them. </li>
  </ul>
