  <h1> Chanters In The Dark III </h1>

  <h4> <b> Date: </b> November 15th, 2024 </h4>
  <h4> <b> Players: </b> Chiara, Lars, Liam, Peter </h4>

  <br>

  <div>

  <h4> <b> Characters </b> </h4>
  <p>
      Chiara played <em> Wolfgang </em> the Dwarven Miner, <em> Lomba </em> the Dwawarven Stonecaster, <em> Tigur </em> the Miller-Baker, and <em> Alida </em> the Halfling Dyer.
  </p>

  <p>
    Lars played <em> Jolie </em> the Elven Navigator, <em> Sam </em> the Parsnip Farmer, <em> Patrick </em> the Healer, and <em> Scrooge </em> the Tax Collector.
  </p>

  <p>
    Liam played <em> Flush </em> the Gambling Wizard, and <em> Genevieve </em>, his trusty Sow.
    </p>

  <p>
    Peter played <em> Willy </em> the Warrior Orphan.
  </p>

  <h4> <b> Summary </b> </h4>

  <p>
    By flickering torchlight, the group debated plans to potentially slay the Caretaker. Flush suggested a cunning trap, poisoning an offering to somehow weaken the creature. Yet the plan seemed to risky, and they abandoned the plan, hoping the creature might cease it's hunt if the group slew it's foul masters.
  </p>

  <p>
    So in the morning, the party made way to the Temple of Yuzz in the south-east, a thirty foot wide and tall monolith of greasy stone blocks jutting out of the cavern wall. Unholy glyphs were etched in the rock in unknown language; something seemed deeply repulsive about them, as though some deeply buried ancestral memory recognized the runes, and rejected what they represent. The archway entrance yawned open, inviting those brave enough to proceed. Haydee split off from the group to scout for a potential escape route to the surface, as the rest of the party entered.
  </p>

  <h4> <b> Part 1: The Summoning Pool </b> </h4>

  <p>
    Beyond the threshold lay a great vaulted hall leading to a vast chamber beyond. The smell of rotting eggs hunt in the air, which had become cool enough for the parties breath becoming visible in the chill. After sending Jeanie into the chamber as a scout, the party travelled forward, leaving Lomba and Jolie to keep watch at the entrance. Inside lay a large square chamber, supported by eight black pillars to the left and right of a shimmering pool, which illuminated the room in a pale, sickly green light.
  </p>

  <p>
    Sam dipped his toe in the pool, which shimmered, slightly oily to the touch, casting small waves across the pool. As Sam took his toe out, the waves began to grow in intensity, as the egg stench grew stronger. The group stepped back as the waves became ferocious, and readied their weapons as the waves formed a troop of translucent green, whipcord-thin reptilian warriors, with bulbous eyes and serrated clubs.
  </p>

  <p>
    A vicious battle ensued. The party scattered -- some took cover up a stairway, others running for a door on the far wall. Pushing it open in panic, Sam triggered a trap, a stone bludgeon which swung from the wall above the door. Inside, dressed in shadow, Sam observed five thrones of greenish-black stone, upon which sat three forms, two with the heads of black sheep, and a larger, central figure with the head of an Ox. A voice called out to Sam "Go! Even Now Your Sins Will Be Forgiven". Sam returned to the room to the fight, but perished to the summoned creatures. Alida held up a holy symbol, but was unable to summon the power to repel the foes. After sustaining enough damage, the creatures lost emerge, dissolving into the foul smelling liquid from which the had been formed.
  </p>

  <h4> <b> Part 2: The Priests of Yuzz </b> </h4>

  <p>
    The party, severely weakened, returned to Glor-Mug for aid. The group took a brief rest, healed by the power of the Fungal Mound they consumed, and then returned to the temple. They descended a staircase in the stone hall to a large chamber lined with shelves of gleaming pearlescent stones. Amid the collection stood Hasth, with the head of a tiger, the eyes covered in gauze. It greeted them with slivering hiss, and managed to lure Willy closer, then quickly leapt forward, plucking Willy's eye in a smooth scoop of it's stone knife. Briefly stunned, Willy allowed Hasth to step back, and some of the party swore they saw Hasth swallowing Willy's eye.  The party overpowered Hasth -- as he died his body burned to ash, leaving behind ragged, patchwork robes made of tiger fur.
  </p>

  <p>
    The group gathered the stones around the rooms, which upon closer observation were clearly petrified eyes. Willy got the urge to put one of the stones in his eye. With caution, the group pinned him down and placed the stone in the eye. It easily fell in, slightly shrunken from whatever ritual Hasth had performed, then began to swell until it filled Willy's eye socket, and new thoughts in Willy's mind began to converse: the eye was once an eye of Ragathor the Greedy, who still lived among the religious followers in the city outside. The eye spoke of the five priests of Yuzz that had collected the eyes: Hasth, Kahl, Kagg, Karg, and their overlord Halmurg, and begged the party to free the eyes from whatever ritual the priests conducted.
  </p>

  <p>
    Up the staircase from the ground floor, the group quickly dispatched Kahl the Open Fist, who meditated up prayer mats of gold and violet above, whose corpse was consumed by worms which sprung from the ground upon his death, leaving behind robes made from tiger fur. The party then stormed the throne room, where the Overlord of Yuzz sat beside his two wizard priests, Kagg and Karg. As Willy charged to Halmurg, he felt a bulbous eye stare deeply at him from beneath the Ox head mask, attempting to control him with some kind of arcane energy. Meanwhile, Kagg and Karg stood up to attack, summoning sickly green spectral duplicates to attack the foes. But Flush, summoning the power of the eyes he held in his arms, unleashed an enormous fiery conflagration that instantly incinerating the lesser priests in hellfire. The Overlord fell soon after, his cursed ring claimed as a token of victory.
  </p>

  <p>
    The group returned to Glor-Mug, who sadly warned them of the danger they were now in. The religious sect in the city had seen the group enter the temple, and the leader of the most devout, an enormous goat-headed beast man called Ordimus, was now searching the city for the group in anger. Glor-Mug's followers didn't have the power to fight Ordimus, but hoped that, now the priests were dead, Ordimus would eventually come to his senses before his tendencies grew self destructive to the people.
  </p>

  <h4> <b> Part 3: The Final Escape </b> </h4>

  <p>
    To avoid Ordimus and his followers, the group were forced to spend a long, cold, damp night within the temple to avoid capture by Ordimus, before fleeing through a dark tunnel behind the throne room, which snaked down in long serpentine loops, as the faint sound of alien chanting became louder and louder. The tunnel passed over an underground river roaring from a torrent above, it's banks littered with shards of wood and ornaments of Willy and Haydee's half boat, a haunting reminder of previous  trials.
  </p>

  <p>
    Crossing the river cautiously, the party pressed onward. Fifty feet ahead, their path was blocked by a pale, glimmering form, a green-white puffball mushroom like creature, balanced atop dozens of legs, with no features beside what could be a ribcage protruding from beneath it's leather exterior. Sensing danger given the resemblance to the Caretaker, the party used stones to lure the creature down the path they wished to travel ahead of them to avoid direct confrontation on the path.
  </p>

  <p>
    The passage opened onto a ledge far beneath the earth, the sulfuric odor of rotting eggs assaulting the party's nostrils. The chanting was now incredibly loud, like the screaming of a thousand zealots. The ledge overlooked an enormous water filled cavern, large enough to lie beneath all the caves above and illuminating the cavern from below in a rippling, sickly green glow, like foxfire off a corpse. Fat flies buzzed over the noisome waters, consumed by hundreds of the fungal insect-crustacean creatures the party had previously encountered in the amphitheater.
  </p>

  <p>
    Attempting the sneak past the Caretaker-like creature, the party edge along the ledge of the cliff face. Yet their movements roused the creature, which with an audible ripping noise opened up to reveal sharp fangs, and a foul fungal tongue. The tongue grabbed Tigur and attempted to pull them into it's maw, but Willy's blade severed the appendage, freeing Tigur, and the group travelled across the ledge.
  </p>

  <p>
    In the waters below the ledge, blind tentacles reached up for the water, as though sensing the party's presence. Ahead, far above, daylight streamed down from above, a mere two hundred feet above a cliff face that looked a relatively easy climb. But as the group began their climb, the corruption below surged upward, spewing forth several chanting creatures, as the Caretaker-like creature scuttled after from below.
  </p>

  <p>
    Sensing the impending peril, Flush called upon three dozen pairs of eyes taken from the Priests of Yuzz. Channeling their combined power, he cast a mighty levitation spell, lifting the party upwards, rapidly outpacing the horrors that chased behind them. They quickly ascended the chamber, gathering treasures littered on the floor below, perhaps one time sacrifices to the beast below.
  </p>

  <p>
    As the group ascending past a makeshift bridge, precariously balanced between the cliff face and the far wall. From the far side, the familiar form of Haydee emerged, crawling very carefully across the bridge on hands and knees, as the stone rocked back and forth. While Haydee had been scouting the cavern, he'd been rescued from Ordimus' wrath by  the glow-worm harvesters he'd befriend, who smuggled him across the city, guided down a ledge beneath a roaring waterfall, leading to the ledge he now traversed.
  </p>

  <p>
    With deliberate care, Haydee made his way towards the cliff face, each movement a gamble against the loose stone which quavered beneath him. His skill and steady hands proved true, and he managed to make it across, though as he stepped onto the cliff face to join the party, the inevitable happened -- the stone dislodged, tumbling into the corruption below with a resounding crash, sealing the horrors below. 
  </p>

  <p>
    The party wasted no time as the cave tremored, threatening to collapse. Haydee ran beneath the levitating party as together they raced for the exit. At long last, the party reached the surface. The warmth of the sun greeted them like an old friend, its golden rays piercing the grime and stone dust which now covered them. For the first time in what felt like an eternity, they could see that brilliant blue sky that seemed almost foreign after so much time underground. Though they stood in the open air, they had no sense of where they had emerged. The underground river, twisting and winding, had carried them far from the keep where their journey began. The landscape around them was unfamiliar, the terrain marked by jagged outcrops and sparse, windswept grasses.
  </p>

  <p>
    Their relief at surviving was tempered by the knowledge of what lay below. The horrors they had encountered -- the corruption in the lake, and the monstrous forms -- had not been vanquished. The makeshift collapse might hold them for now, but for how long? Whether sealed for a century, a millennium, or merely a fleeting year, the horrors would remain, biding their time. Patient. And waiting.
