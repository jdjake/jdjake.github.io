    <h1> Buried in the Bahamas </h1>

  <h4> <b> Date: </b> February 22nd, 2024 </h4>
  <h4> <b> Players: </b> Gary, Hugh, Abe, Parash </h4>

  <br>

  <div>

  <h4> <b> Characters </b> </h4>
  <p>
    Hugh played <em> Low Roller </em>, a swashbuckler who concealed a mysterious past as a barkeep with a liking for mocking banter amongst the other crewmates. There was <em>something contagious</em> about him.
  </p>
  <p>
    Abe played <em>Bep 'Gunpowder' Glover</em>, a Jesuit Monk based on the isle of Yuma. Known for his stench, the rotten teeth hanging out of his mouth, and his preference for alchohol.
  </p>
  <p>
    Gary played <em>Annemicke 'Flatline' Hollegate</em>, a known pirate and heretic amongst the colonial powers of the Caribbean. He'd gained a knack for wilderness survival, even if it'd cost him his right eye in the process.
  </p>
  <p>
  	Parash played <em>Eva 'Two Toes' Martinez</em>, a Rotund wig-wearing Buccaneer. Marooned after a failed mutinee aboard the Portugeuse navy, Eva picked himself up and had been running some odd jobs to make a name for himself in the free ports of the Carribean.
  </p>

  <h4> <b> Part 1: Back To Port Nelson </b> </h4>

  <p>
  	The gang made their way with the treasure from the tomb back to town. To celebrate, they brought a round of drinks for everyone at the bar, and celebrated. Gary lost some money at dice, while Hugh met another pirate at the bar, Eva 'Two Toes' Martinez, played by Parash, a fat Buccaneer with a wig blowing in his face. Parash was a medic serving in the Portuguese navy, but tried to lead a failed mutiny after not getting paid his month wages, and was left abandoned on an island. He managed to find his way to Port Fortune, one of the largest free ports in the area, and had been running some jobs here and there for some crew. Recently, he was approached by a fancily dressed gentlemen, who gave his name as Samuel. On behalf of his employer, he approached Eva with a job. Astronomers employed by his boss had identified a fallen meteorite which had landed in the nearby island of Yuma. Since this was firmly in Pirate territory, his boss needed someone more unscrupulous  to travel there and recover the meteorite. Eva accepted the job, and was dropped off in Port Nelson. He'd headed to the inn to try and find some associates to, and had ran into Gary and Hugh. Convinced by their previous successes in the tomb, they made a deal to head off to the island the next morning, and drank the rest of the night away.
  </p>

  <p>
  	The next morning, they woke up, slightly hungover, but couldn't wake Dan from his drunken slumber. They were finishing their morning ablutions when they were startled by a ramshackle monk who burst into the tavern. The first thing that hit them was the absolute stench of the man, before noticing the mans rags. He then told them of the events of the morning, through the few teeth he had remaining in his mouth.
  </p>

  <h4> <b> Part 2: The Events of the Morning </b> </h4>

  <p>
  	The monk was a Jesuit missionary, sent off to a far off region of the Carribean, likely to get his foul stench away from the rest of the missionaries. That morning, the monk had slept in in his bed on the 2nd floor of his small chapel on the isle of Yuma, ignoring the steady rapping on his front door. He got up at least an hour later, and the knocks continued. Finally opening the door, he was faced with a pallid man, with a huge bite taken out of his shoulder, with two hollow eye sockets and a lifeless moan - a zombie. The man lunged at Abe, who dodged, and responded by picking up his cutlass from near the entryway, and impaling the zombie with the blade, skewering the zombie to the wooden floor of the chapel. Hearing moans from the jungle outside, Abe ran upstairs to prepare what he could. He grabbed whatever alchohol he could that would fit into a bucket, grabbed a lit candle from his bedside, and headed downstairs. Three zombies had entered the chapel in the meantime, and were shambling down the aisle to the pulpit. Abe poured some alchohol out onto the floor, spattering the oncoming zombies with it, and then lit the alchohol with the candle. As the chapel lit ablaze, Abe took the pulpit and began a sermon, cursing the zombies writhing on the floor for their sins. When the blaze grew too great, he had to flee through a window. Hearing more moans come from the jungle, he tried to take his cutlass from the fire, but couldn't pull the cutlass out in the chaos of the blaze. He took his dinghy from the shoreline next to the chapel, and tried to paddle to wherever would be safe.
  </p>

  <h4> <b> Part 3: Onwards to Yuma </b> </h4>

  <p>
  	Abe told his tale in Port Fortune. After some convincing from Parash, the gang agreed to take the dinghy back to the tower, whether to recover what they could from the chapel, or to find the meteorite on the island. They gathered up supplies from Port Fortune, including supplies for three days food and water, and a bucket of tar, and took the dinghy to Yuma. Given it's weight, Totonton stayed behind on the island, pretending to be a statue.
  </p>

  <p>
  	As they neared Yuma, they saw a body face down in the water. They deliberated on avoiding the body, meanwhile, out of the weeds of the shallows came 3 zombies, clutching onto the side of the boat. One grabbed a hold of Hugh, pulling him into the ocean below. Parash managed to take his musket and blow the zombie head in two who had a hold of Hugh, and Hugh was able to escape the dead zombie's grasp and swim back onto the boat. Meanwhile, Gary and Abe tried to fight off the zombies as they clambered onto the boat. The zombies tried to take bites out of the pair, but Gary and Abe dodged the bites, and the group responded by killing the two remaining zombies.
  </p>

  <p>
  	Now on shore, the gang headed south for the remains of the chapel. The chapel had completely burned up, but Abe managed to recover his cutless, cleaning off the ash on the group. Parash found a cross on a necklace, while Abe decided to take a giant wooden statue of Jesus on a cross, which he decided to use as a weapon to smite the zombies. The chapel was on the verge of the jungle that overflowed out of the southern half of the island. The gang made preparation, taking a thimble from Parash's first aid kit and using it to make a hole in the bucket of tar to use to avoid getting lost in the maze. With their supplies prepared, they entered the jungle.
