    <h1> Buried in the Bahamas </h1>

  <h4> <b> Date: </b> February 22nd, 2024 </h4>
  <h4> <b> Players: </b> Gary, Hugh, Abe, Parash </h4>

  <br>

  <div>

  <h4> <b> Characters </b> </h4>
  <p>
    Hugh played <em> Low Roller </em>, a swashbuckler who concealed a mysterious past as a barkeep with a liking for mocking banter amongst the other crewmates. There was <em>something contagious</em> about him.
  </p>
  <p>
    Abe played <em>Bep 'Gunpowder' Glover</em>, a Jesuit Monk based on the isle of Yuma. Known for his stench, the rotten teeth hanging out of his mouth, and his preference for alchohol.
  </p>
  <p>
    Gary played <em>Annemicke 'Flatline' Hollegate</em>, a known pirate and heretic amongst the colonial powers of the Caribbean. He'd gained a knack for wilderness survival, even if it'd cost him his right eye in the process.
  </p>
  <p>
  	Parash played <em>Eva 'Two Toes' Martinez</em>, a Rotund wig-wearing Buccaneer. Marooned after a failed mutinee aboard the Portugeuse navy, Eva picked himself up and had been running some odd jobs to make a name for himself in the free ports of the Carribean.
  </p>

  <h4> <b> Part 1: Back To Port Nelson </b> </h4>

  <p>
  	The surviving members of the Tarantula made their way back to Port Nelson with whatever treasure they could carry from the tomb. They celebrated their success by buying a round for everyone at the inn. Annemicke played dice, and lost some cash, while Low Roller found company with pirates at the counter of the bar, in particular, Eva "Two Toes" Martinez, played by Parash, a fat Buccaneer with a wig that constanly blew into his face, obscuring it.
  </p>

  <p>
  	Eva shared the story that had led him here. He'd been a medic in the Portugeuse navy, and shared the tale of an ill-planned mutiny after not recieving his monthly wages. As punishment, he was marooned on a desert island. He managed to find his way to Port Fortune, one of the larger free ports on the area, and had been running odd jobs for various crews to make a living.
  </p>

  <p>
  	Recently, he'd been approached by a dignified gentlement by the name of Samuel, who gave him a job on behalf of his employer. Astronomers under his boss's employ had identified a fallen meteorite of scientific interest, that had recently landed on the nearby island of Yuma. Being firmly in Pirate territory, they needed a more unscrupulous individual to travel there and recover the meteorite, and were willing to pay well. Eva was convinced, and was dropped off by Samuel in Port Nelson that afternoon, hoping to find some associated to help him recover the metteorite. Convinced by the gang's previous successes in the tomb, Eva made a deal with the gang to head off to the island the following morning, and drank the rest of the night away.
  </p>

  <p>
  	The next morning, nursing hangovers, they arose from slumber, but couldn't wake up Dan from his drunken slumber. While finishing their morning ablutions, they were startled by a disheveled monk who barged into the tavern, his putrid odor preceding his entrance. Using the few remaining teeth left in his mouth, the monk recounted the harrowing events of the previous morning.
  </p>

  <h4> <b> Part 2: The Events of the Morning </b> </h4>

  <p>
  	The monk, Bep "Gunpoweder" Glover, was a Jesuit missionary, sent off to a far off region of the Carribean to proselytize, likely to get his foul stench away from the rest of the Jesuits monks.
  </p>

  <p>
  	That morning, the monk had overslept in his small chapel on the isle of Yuma. He had ignored a persistant knocking on the door of the chapel for the past hour, but eventually got up and answered the door. He was faced with a pallid man, with a huge bite taken out of his shoulder, with two hollow eye sockets making a lifeless moan. The zombie lunged at Bep, who dodged, responding by picking up his cutlass from the near the entryway and skewering it to the floor of the chapel. Hearing moans from the jungle outside, Bep ran upstairs to prepare what he could. He grabbed whatever alchohol that would fit into a bucket, grabbed a lit candle from his bedside, and headed downstairs.
  </p>

  <p>
  	Downstairs, three zombies shambled up the aisle of the chapel towards the pulpit. Bep splashed alchohol over the advancing zombies, and then used the candle to light them on fire. As the chapel lit ablaze, Bep took the pulpit and began a fiery sermon, cursing the zombies writhing on the floor for their sins. When the inferno grew too great, he had to make an escape through a nearby window. Hearing more moans coming through the jungle canopy, he attempted to make his escape. Failing to grab his cutlass from the blaze, he took to the nearby shoreline without weapons, boarding his dinghy, and attempting to paddle to safety.
  </p>

  <h4> <b> Part 3: Onwards to Yuma </b> </h4>

  <p>
  	Bep told his tale back in Port Nelson. After some convincing from Eva, the gang agreed to take the dinghy back to the isle, to recover what they could find from the chapel, and then head on to try and search for the meteorite. They gathered up supplies from Port Nelson, including three days provisions, and a bucket of pine tar, and took the dinghy to Yuma. Given it's weight, Totonton couldn't fit on the dinghy, remaining behind on the island, camouflaged as a statue.
  </p>

  <p>
  	As they neared Yuma, they saw a lifeless body floating face down in the water. While they were discussing how to avoid the possibly infected body, three zombies ambushed them, emerging from underneath the boat, out of the weeds of the shallows, clutching onto the side of the boat. One grabbed ahold of Low Roller, pulling him into the ocean below. A struggle ensued, before Eva took his musket and blew the zombie's head in two who clutched onto Low Roller. Low Roller was able to elude the dead zombie's grasp and swim back onto the boat. Meanwhile, Annemicke and Bep tried to fight off the zombies as they slowly clambered onto the boat. The zombies tried to take bites out of the pair, but Annemicke and Bep dodged the bites, and the group managed to get rid of the zombies unscathed.
  </p>

  <p>
  	Once on shore, the gang headed south to the remnants of the chapel, now reduced to ashes. Bep managed to recover his now charred cutlass, cleaning off the ash in the dirt of the clearing surrounding the chapel. Eva found a fist sized cross on a necklace, and decided to keep ahold of it, while Bep decided to take a colossal wooden statue of Jesus on a cross, somehow unscathed by the fire, and decided to use it to smite those zombies still remaining on the island. 
  </p>

  <p>
  	The chapel was on the verge of the billowing jungle that overflowed out of the southern half of the island. Eva took a thimble from his first aid kit, and used it to make a small hole in the bucket of tar to use as a guide to avoid getting lost in the jungle. They made final prepations, and were then ready to head into the bush.
