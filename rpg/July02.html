    <h1> Making A Run For It </h1>

  <h4> <b> Date: </b> July 2nd, 2024 </h4>
  <h4> <b> Players: </b> Avi, Abe, Dan, Gary </h4>

  <br>

  <div>

  <h4> <b> Characters </b> </h4>
  <p>
    Avi played <em>'Stuttering' Sam</em>, a hideously ugly, annoyingly religion rapscallion with a haunted past. He joined the gang in Port Fortune; he knew Annemicke from when they were pirates about Captain Cabbagehead's Ship, 'The Queen Isabella's Malice'
  </p>
  <p>
    Abe played <em>Bep 'Gunpowder' Glover</em>, a Jesuit Monk based on the isle of Yuma. Known for his stench, the rotten teeth hanging out of his mouth, and his preference for alchohol.
  </p>
  <p>
    Dan played <em>Iago ‘Le Red Bird’</em>, a backstabbing rapscallion, a sailor with an insatiable urge for treasure. His previous adventures lead him to a narrow escape from a cannibalistic ending, but he never escaped <em>that smell</em>.
  </p>
  <p>
    Gary played <em>Annemicke 'Flatline' Hollegate</em>, a known pirate and heretic amongst the colonial powers of the Caribbean. He'd gained a knack for wilderness survival, even if it'd cost him his right eye in the process.
  </p>

  <h4> <b> BLAH </b> </h4>

  <ul>
    <li> You found a cave on Skeleton Cove Island, containing a vast basalt structure floating on an undulating lake. You passed into the cave, through to a dark, undulating lake with ocean currents surrounding a perfectly rectangular ancient, antediluvian basalt structure. </li>
    <li> You entered the structure under the archway formed from a statue of woman with raised arms, with a blank mask covering her face and wormy tendrils peeking from the edges. You fought your way through the monolith, through a chamber of pools illuminated from below by pale aquamarine light. Each pool was occupied by local islanders, with fledgling tentacles emerging from melting faces. </li>
    <li> You had a vision of a purple, gaunt humanoid entity meditating on a malachite Dais, it's skin taut over a deformed skull morphed into a spiral shell. It wears no clothing (it's body covered in a carapace) aside from a chain necklace is a conical, spiral skull, glowing green with power. Human skulls lie discarded around the Dais, each of their craniums perforates with 5 holes. Purple eyes glowed from within the shell, and the creature addressed you directly through the vision, accusing you of scuttling through their domain, disturbing their communion. </li>
    <li> You flee from the sounds of footsteps, into a quite open room covered in the shells of trilobites and brachiopods, with six  in which six statues identical to the entrance statue faced a woman with a tentacled, Nautiloid head, with details worn smooth with age, with hands extended and cupped in front of her. </li>
    <li> Abe felt drawn to the statue, and made prayer as the rest of you fled into a corridor on the other side of the room. The armed creatures charged into the room, miraculously ignoring Abe right out in the open of the room. Passing Abe by allowed you to set up an ambush to take out the initial wave of creatures. </li>
    <li> You passed into a dead end, a room with a gradually deepening pool, eventually ending with a wide grate 10 feet under the water. Scraps of sailing clothing died black (loose fitting linens, ripped leather with belt buckles still attached, etc.). You fished out the chests, obtaining some treasure, but also freeing a black oozing mass that began to expand beyond it's confines once freed. Abe used his weather prayer to blow off the grate, and you managed to escape just as the mollusc people reached you. </li>
    <li> You left through the grate, into a large water filled cave, with an exit on the far end. You fought off some eels, and made it out into a clearing past some steep rocky cliffs, likely on the other side of the mountain. A ship laid abandoned on the beach, and as you made camp the ship made no indication of life. </li>
  </ul>
