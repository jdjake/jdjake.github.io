      <h1> Rhalabhast and the Blood Drinking Box </h1>

      <h4> <b> Date: </b> November 24th, 2024 </h4>
      <h4> <b> Players: </b> Chiara, Lars, Liam, Patrick </h4>

      <br>

      <div>
        <h4> <b> Characters </b> </h4>
        <p>
          Chiara played <em> Alida </em> the Halfling Dyer, and <em>Lomba</em> the Dwarf.
        </p>

        <p>
          Lars played <em> Jolie </em> the Elven Navigator, <em> Patrick </em> the Healer, and <em> Scrooge </em> the Tax Collector.
        </p>

        <p>
          Patrick played <em>John</em>, a vindictive rutabaga farmer, <em>Zephyr</em>, a streetwise urchin, <em>Logart</em>, a stalwart Dwarven Blacksmith, and <em>Doug</em>, Logart's assistant.
        </p>

        <h4> <b> Part 1: Rhalabhast, of Many Eyes </b> </h4>

        <p>
          The party fled from the Chanters in the Dark Below. They wandered above the surface for some time, lost first in wasteland, and then dense forest. Day passed before they at least stumbled upon a clearing. At it's center stood a lone tower of weathered stone, bristling with telescopes of every concievable shape, angle, and aperture from it's upper windows.
        </p>

        <p>
          There they met Rhalabhast, of Many Eyes, a reclusive wizard of considerable repute, who took pity on the party. He allowed them refuge to camp outside his tower, while they recovered from the ordeals of previous weeks. Lomba, Scrooge, and Alida sprouted new eyes from their sockets, as the fungal matter they consumed below began their work, while Willy grew accustomed to his new eyeball he had procured from the Temple of Yuzz, the eye of Ragathor the Greedy.
        </p>

        <p>
          In return for carrying out small tasks like gathering herbs and sweeping dusty rooms of the tower, Rhalabhast taught some of the more magically minded of the party a few simple spells. Patrick learned <em>Shazirian's Prismatic Spray</em>, a spell to conjure dazzling light to bedazzle and confuse, and Jolie learned <em>Kram's Impermeable Aegis</em>, which summons forth magical shielding.
        </p>

        <p>
          One evening, at twilight, Rhalabhast summoned the party to his tower. They gathered around a hearth built into the central supporting column of the tower. Rhalabhast regarded the party with a pensive mien, his fingers creating a temple over his nose, casting shadows over his thumbs, which cradled his silver-bearded chin below. After an uncomfortable long moment of silence, he began.
        </p>

        <p>
          "I have a favor to ask you all. My rival, Nekros the Grotsque &mdash; that visionless dullard of a sorcerer, with all the cunning of a damp sponge &mdash; is in possession of a powerful artifact that would be of much use to me. I cannot obtain it by myself, for reasons that will soon be clear, so I was hoping you would be able to retrieve  it for me. Succeed, and I'll provide you with whatever my arcane means can provide".
        </p>

        <p>
          The party nodded, cautiously, and Rhalabhast leaned forward,:
        </p>

        <p>
          "It's a simple box, cylindrical, about 3 feet in height and diameter. For your own safety, do not open the box. There is something trapped inside, from the deepest of the nine hells. Nekros is a nimwit, and cannot be trusted with what's inside. But I, Rhalabhast of the Many Eyes, can ensure it remains imprisoned, and harness it's power for exceptional purposes. Nekros is away from his lair, so he should be no bother. And Nekros is an amateur, I'm sure you'll make light work of the traps he may have set forth".
        </p>

        <p>
          "There's just... a small complication. The box demands blood &mdash; five pints a day, from the innocent, the virtuous, the law abiding. The blood need not be taken by mortal wounds, but the blood must be drawn nonetheless. Should the tribute cease, the box's wards will collapse, and the evil inside will break free to wreak havoc on it's surroundings. Under no circumstances let what is imprisoned in that box out. That would be a fatal error".
        </p>

        <p>
          Rhalabhast pushed a parchment across the table, scrawled in his archaic-looking handwriting. "An informant close to Nekros revealed some information about his lair, but refused to give me any specifics, except that in the form of a riddle: 'Travel three days north, near a waterfall at Boulder Cliff. When the dead look to the sky, a way into the cliff will appear'. Solve the riddle, find that box, and bring it back to me, unopened, and I'll reward you considerably."
        </p>

        <p>
          The party exchanged uneasy glances.
        </p>

        <p>
          "This", remarked Patrick, "sounds like an absolute disaster".
        </p>

        <p>
          "Excellent", remarked Scrooge. "We leave at dawn".
        </p>

        <h4> <b> Part 2: From East Troy to Boulder Cliff </b> </h4>

        <p>
          On the way to Boulder Cliff, the party took a detour to the town of East Troy. The party needed to ensure they had enough innocent blood to satiate the box, and hoped to find townsfolk naive enough that they might satisfy the infernal box. Zephyr, a streetwise urchin, was lured by the promise of treasure. Logart, a no-nonsense Dwarven blacksmith, joined to ensure his town did not meet certain doom. Doug, Logart's beleagered assitant joined, because Logart told him so.  Smyrnov, an elven barrister, joined for reasons that remained suspiciously vague. Bogimir the Ostler sought a worthy adventure before old age claimed him. And finally, there was Josh, a rutabaga farmer on the outskirts of town, who nursed a peculiar grudge against Nekros, who'd passed up his vegetables for his neighbors joined their cause.
        </p>

        <p>
          Three days hard march brought the party to the gargantuan stones of Boulder Cliff, where a mighty waterfall plummeted through jagged rocks into a dark pool below. At the cliff's base, the sickly-sweet smell of death wafted from a bear’s decaying corpse and the shredded remains of six hunters. The rotted weapons and armor suggested the hunt was decades old, yet the stench of death smelt fresh. There were often tales of wanderers wandering deep into the forest and becoming lost, but none of the party from East Troy had heard any hunters go missing of late.
        </p>

        <p>
          Lomba suggested turning the bodies to face the heavens, reciting the riddle's cryptic criteria: "When the dead look to the sky, the path shall be revealed". But as Lomba reached down to adjust the head of one of the hunters, a sinister rot rapidly spread from the hunter, up through Lomba's arms. In panic, Patrick poured holy water on the wounds, which seemed to stop the rot from spreading further. More cautiously, the group turned the rest of the bodies over with more stocky branches scavenged from the surrounding woodland, and a boulder in the cliffside began to rotate, revealing an inner passage in the rock. The party made way to the entrance, beginning their journey into the unknown.
        </p>







        <h4> <b> Part 3: The Long, Long Staircase </b> </h4>

        <p>
          The passage opened to an immense chamber, so large that it's opposite side was beyond vision, dropping into darkness. From a stone platform upon which the party entered, thin, roughly hewn stairs spiraled downwards along a slightly curved wall, with no guardrail to prevent falling into the abyssal darkness below. The party began to descend down the stairs. As they hiked, the air grew colder, and an eerie silence enveloped them. Their torchlight cast long shadows that danced upon the rough-hewn wall.
        </p>

        <p>
          After several hours of hiking, loud laughter, malevolent and mocking, came from the chamber around them. Josh, his voice trembling with a mix of fear and resolve, called out, "Who goes there?". The laughter ceased, though it's faint echoes bounced off the walls in the darkness. The adventurers exchanged wary glances, their hands gripping their weapons and torches tightly.
        </p>

        <p>
          Jolie decided to try casting Nianam's Aegis &mdash; Jolie's idiosyncratic casting method brought forth heat lightning and thunder on the caster, and she hoped that casting the spell might illuinate the cavern enough to learn something about the unending path they had began to descend. Jolie tried to cast the spell, but it backfired. Though summoning a brief spray of lightning, the mage's elven ears began to shrivel and fold in upon themselves, consumed by the chanelled spell. The brief light allowed the party to observe the immensity of the cavern, at least a hundred and fifty metres across to the stairs on the other side, but not the bottom, which remained dark below.
        </p>

        <p>
          "By the gods", muttered Logart, looking at Jolie's ears. "This is why I distrust magic".
        </p>

        <p>
          Doug nodded in agreement, his expression grim. "Only brings trouble", he concurred.
        </p>

        <p>
          Out of the darkness, the voice below responded to the thunder "Haha! Now I can see you!", and let out another cackling round of laughter.
        </p>

        <p>
          Undeterred, the adventurers pressed on. "We need to keep moving", urged Josh, his voice steady despite the lingering echoes of laughter.
        </p>

        <p>
          Zephyr, still wary, kept his eyes on the shadows. "Is that the laughter of Nekros?" he asked.
        </p>

        <p>
          "No", replied Josh, "I'd recognize that grotesque laugh anywhere. There's another force at play here".
        </p>

        <p>
          The adventurers trudged forward for another few hours. Along the way, Logart examined the stone walls. There was no sign of deliberate masonry. They appeared to have been dug through by some powerful force.
        </p>

        <p>
          The group's senses dulled by the monotony of travel. But Jolie occasionally cast a wary glance behind the group, which paid out. Several hours into the journey, Jolie noticed a sudden movement. Turning to face the source, Jolie's keen eyes caught sight of movement in the shadows &mdash; five emaciated, hairless, feline creatures, their bulbous black eyes gleaming with predatory hunger.
        </p>

        <p>
          The gautn forms creatures moved with disconcerting speed. The stairway, narrow and confining, allowed little room for maneuvers. Jolie, quick on his feet, alerted the party. "Wild cats, behind us! Prepare yourselves!", while preparing her short bow. From behind, Patrick readied a spell, letting loose a barrage of sparks of colours which blinded one of the cats, while Doug slipped forward and managed to push a cat off the ledge into the darkness below.
        </p>

        <p>
          Logart, decided to intimidate the remaining creatures. He banged his hammer against the wall, producing a thunderous clamor that echoed throughout the cavern. "You better get out of here, or we'll kill every last one of you!" he roared. This display of bravado worked - the cats, perhaps unnerved by the shouts and sparks of colors around them, scampered back up the staircase into the shadows above.
        </p>

        <p>
          The party regrouped, catching their breath and assessing their situation. "Did anyone hear a thud when that cat was pushed off?" asked Doug. No one responded &mdash; the abyss below seemed endless.
        </p>

        <p>
          The party debated continuing down the stairwell. Jolie suggested they might need to think more creatively. "This wizard mentioned traps and tricks. What if this stairwell is just another illusion? Perhaps we just need to jump into the abyss".
        </p>

        <p>
          "Perhaps," mused Logart. "But it feels real enough. We've been walking for hours, and I'm beginning to tire. Let's take a rest, and then tomorrow we can try other solutions".
        </p>

        <p>
          The group set up on camp on the staircase, and began to sleep. But just as the group were winning the fight for sleep against the uncomfortable steps, the hysterical laughter that they had heard before returned. It danced around the camp as the group slept, cackling with laughter, shouting directly into the party's ears as they slept.
        </p>

        <p>
          "I see you!", the voice cackled, then began to describe each party member in detail. "You, the short dwarf. You're going to die in here! Ahahahahahaha". Only Lomba, the deepest sleeper of them all, was able to ignore the harrassment.
        </p>

        <p>
          In the morning, the group groggly continued their descent. Josh suggested using a grappling hook to repel down the stairs. But this approach seemed too risky, the stairs directly below were at least a hundred feet down, and so the adventurers pressed onward.
        </p>

        <p>
          As they continued, the group couldn't shake the feeling of being watched. Yet, they saw no signs of life or movement, save for their shadows flickering against the stone. "Keep alert," warned Zephyr. "Whatever lies ahead, we must be ready."
        </p>

        <p>
          The party again debated whether they were trapped within an illusion. "We need to test if these stairs loop around," proposed Doug. "Let's drop a coin below, and see if we encounter it again."
        </p>

        <p>
          Scrooge, ever resourceful, pulled out a single copper coin. "I'll drop this down. Let's see if we can find it again". He tossed the coin onto the stairs below. The adventurers pressed on, and after another hour of descent, the coin appeared on the steps.
        </p>

        <p>
          As the hours dragged on, the group's spirits again waned. Jolie came up with a plan: "I shall attempt to scry tactics from my patron Aristemis, god of strategy". Jolie had formed a bond with Aristemis while recovering in the woods around Rhalabhast's tower, playing games of chess against herself in the hopes that the ideas that came to her head for future moves might provide insight from the goddess. Jolie drew a magic circle, and began the incantation. Faint whispers began to echo in Jolie's mind: "Continue downwards, and you shall see the truth of the matter eventually." The mystic shared the good news with the rest of the group.
        </p>

        <p>
          "We must have wandered for at least another day. I am so tired. We should make camp again." But just as the party found peace, a dreadful rumbling echoed from above, as if a boulder was hurtling down the staircase toward the party. Their hearts raced as they ran, but the boulder never arrived to crush the party. With adrenaline raised, they again were unable to get proper sleep.
        </p>

        <p>
          During Jolie's watch, the stalking cats returned, creeping back from the shadows above, ready to strike. A fierce battle ensued, with cats spewing toxic bile at Jolie, which drained Jolie's strength until she fell unconscious. Josh released a hen from a cage he was carrying to distract the wild cats; two pursued the hen as it fled down the steps. One cat remained, wounded but not vanquished. It tried to drag Jolie, unconscious but alive, up the stairway, but the party was able to subdue the cat before it managed to escape with Jolie. Logart carried Jolie's body over his shoulder, and they continued the hike down.
        </p>




        <h4> <b> Part 4: That Foul Pool Below </b> </h4>

        <p>
          The group pressed on, through the labyrinthine depths of the keep, until they reached a luminescent perforated floor of mystical energy, an Apollonian net hovering translucent above a golden, sulforous pool below. Alida identified the telltale shimmer as a spell: "One of Nolenapia's Mystic Forms &mdash; it provides a platform that magnifies the abilities of spellcasters who stand upon it." At the centre, a huge mound of guano arose out of the pool, meeting the platform in it's centre.
        </p>

        <p>
          The party tied themselves together with rope, and began to traverse the narrow walkways of the gasket. But then calamity struck. Alida the nimble halfling, was pushed off a platform by some invisible force. Dangling precariously, invisible claws sliced through the rope above, and Alida plunged into the golden sulfurous pool below. The sing-songy voice called out from above "I've got you now!"
        </p>

        <p>
          The remaining end of the rope, though severed, was <em>just</em> enough to reach Alida in the water below. "Lower it down. Quickly!" Logart urged.
        </p>

        <p>
          The group worked with haste. As the rope descended, Alida felt a chill down her spine. "Creatures approach," she shouted up, her eyes wide with urgency, as shiny, black-spotted swirling ochre-green bodies reminiscent of blown glass emerged behind her.
        </p>

        <p>
          Lomba's grip tightened. "We must act swiftly".
        </p>

        <p>
          From above, Zephyr took shots at the creatures below with a shortbow, buying Alida just enough time to grasp the rope and be hoisted back to safety.
        </p>

        <p>
          "Claws severed the rope. We face an invisible foe", Alida exclaimed.
        </p>

        <p>
          Lomba mused, "Do we possess any means to reveal them?".
        </p>

        <p>
          Alida nodded. "I have a bag of flour in my supplies".
        </p>

        <p>
          "Excellent". "Let's try and use it to reveal our spectral adversary".
        </p>

        <p>
          Josh volunteered to venture forth, flour in hand. Again the invisible force attacked, but this time Josh was able to dodge out of the way, spraying flour all around, and revealing the outline of a taloned, man-sized creature, devoid of wings yet gliding through the air as if propelled by sorcery. "Haha! Now you can see me!" called out the creature from above.
        </p>

        <p>
          Zephyr, face scrunched with determinantion, notched the second last arrow in their bow with determination. The projectile sailed through the gloom, critically striking the creature squarely in it's baleful eye. "That's not meant to happen!" the creature shrieking, like a spoiled child. Taking the moment, the party dashed across the platform towards the grotesque guano mound at the centre. A double door was embedded in the mound, made from some hard, glassy, opaque material. Hoping to escape the creature, Zephyr deftly picked the lock on the door, and the group rushed through.
        </p>

        <h4> <b> Part 5: The Blood Drinking Box </b> </h4>

        <p>
          The glass doors revealed an obsidian chamber inside, shaped like a five-pointed star. The air thrummed from the heart of the chamber, where a bone-white vessel sat upon a raised pentagonal dais. A fine network of copper tubing encased the vessel, radiating outward like spokes from a central open reservoir. From the ceiling, thin pipes dripped a steady trickle of blood into the font below, siphoned from a ring of grim metallic closets encircling the room. Thin, raspy breathing echoed around the chamber.
        </p>

        <p>
          Logart, percieving the malevolent power of the artifact, urged it's immediate annihilation. Yet the promises of arcane secrets from Rhalabhast swayed the other members of the party. Jolie mendaciously declared that Aristemis, patron deity of East Troy, had warned them not to destroy the box, lest unthinkable horrors be unleashed. Logart furrowed his brow, yet yielded to this appeal to divine authority.
        </p>

        <p>
          Alida surmized that the raspy breathing emanated from one of the metallic closets. She lead the party in search of whatever lurked within. Most contained lifeless husks chained within, bodies punctured with tubes, their essence siphoned away. But one still lived &mdash; a dying Justician monk, his lifeblood near siphoned away. With his final breath, he raised his head to look at the party, and ushered a grim warning: "Bleed for the box, or it will come!". His head slumped forward, lifeless, as at that moment the box began to emit an ominous, wet gurgling sound.
        </p>

        <p>
          Patrick took a knife, and without a second thought sliced the wrists of Jolie's unconscious body. Her blood slithered into the box's funnel, and the gurgling began to cease. With the immediate horror abated, the party made haste to depart.
        </p>

        <p>
          Yet as the group crossed back over the sulfurous pool, a high-pitched shrieking erupted around the cavern. From the guano-crusted mound swarmed a flock of pink, fleshy globules—grapefruit-sized abominations covered in a chaotic array of eyes, wings, and slavering mouths. The creatures fell upon Logart, sinking their needle-like teeth into him, their gelatinous bodies coalescing around his legs to root him in place. Scrooge, beset on all sides, lost his footing and plunged into the pool.
        </p>

        <p>
          The battle raged, and though battered and bleeding, the party emerged victorious. Scrooge, against all odds, was roused from unconsciousness. Jolie was too, as the group roused her by using the sulfurous liquid as smelling salts. And so the group began their three-day journey home. 
        </p>

        <p>
          Each morning, the party awoke to the gurgling of the wanting box. Logart adamantly refused to provide any blood to the accursed vessel, and ordered Doug to do the same. Jolie begged the two for more contributions, pleading the two to notice how pale and weak she looked, but her pitiful appeals went unheeded. The burden fell upon the others to keep the box sated.
        </p>

        <p>
          Two days later, the party emerged from the depths. Preparing for the trek to East Troy, they spotted an unusual sight &mdash; eight rotund, squat humanoids trudging along the riverbank, carrying a motionless human upon their shoulders. Patrick plucked a handful of eldritch eyes from the satchel of horrors he had looted from the Temple of Yuzz. He popped them into his mouth like sweetmeats and, with newfound mystical vigor, unleashed a coruscating blast of colorful chaotic energy. The hapless creatures were instantly knocked unconscious. The party wasted no time. With ruthless efficiency, they hacked their unconscious foes apart.
        </p>

        <p>
          The same disembodied voice that taunted the party earlier rang out from above.
        </p>

        <p>
          "Well done. You have been not only entertaining but helpful. I think the cleric over there is fair payment. Perhaps we’ll meet again. Farewell!"
        </p>

        <p>
          "Good Riddance", shouted Logart, as the grating laughter that had accompanied their descent into Nekro's lair faded into the distance.
        </p>

        <p>
          The party turned their attention to the body carried by the creatures &mdash; a man clad in simple monk robes. Logart again applied a vial of the sulfurous fluid from below, to the nose of the monk. He jolted upright, blinking in bewilderment. “Where am I?” he stammered.
        </p>

        <p>
          "You are safe now", Logart reassured him. "We found you in the custody of those creatures. What happened?"

          The monk, who introduced himself as Father Valbris of the order of Choranus, recounted his tale: while gathering herbs, he was set upon by unseen assailants who knocked him unconscious. While telling his tale, Valbris' gaze settled upon the box, and his face darkened. “I sense this vessel harbors a great and terrible evil". After the party explained the story that had brought them to Valbris, he continued: "My order may possess the means to purge what is inside &mdash; if you would bring it to West Troy rather than leave it in the hands of an unpredicatable sorcerer".

          The party argued vigorously as to the correct course of action. But ultimately, the party were swayed. Taking the box to the followers of Choranus, father of creation, was likely the safer course of action. Logart, begrudgingly, and Valbris, solemnly, pledge to contribute some blood to the feeding of the box if it would help in the journey to cleanse the box of evil.

          Another three days passed, and the party arrived at West Troy &mdash; an industrial city bustling with activity. They made their way to the Temple of Choranos, a grand structure built from beautifully maintained mahogany. The monks there greeted them, accepting the box, and vowed to see it cleansed. The adventurers, having risked life and limb, sought a reward for their efforts. The monks, though ascetic, were not without influence, and agreed to put in good word to the mayor who might be able to bestow some token of gratitude.

          The next day, the adventurers were honored by the mayor, who rewarded them with gold and honorary titles. Mission accomplished, the adventurers decided to return to Rhalabhast to inform him of what had taken place. As they approached his tower, Rhalabhast greeted them eagerly.

          "Have you brought the box?" he asked, his beady eyes alight with expectation.

          The party bumbled for a bit, before Patrick stepped forward. "We had to leave it at the Temple of Caranas. It contained great evil, and they are cleansing the box so it will bother no one any more."

        <p>
          Rhalabhast's face twisted in anger. "You fools! That box was mine! After all I've done for you, you betray me! I was so close to completing my life's work! Be gone! I see far from the eyescopes of my tower. Never return within sight, or doom will await!

          Zephyr, the opportunist, attempted to steal a book from Rhalabhast's study while distracted by anger, but was caught. Rhalabhast caught him in the act and cursed the thief &mdash; his once-dark locks turned ghostly white, a mark of the wizard’s ire.

          Knowing well enough when they had overstayed their welcome, the adventurers beat a hasty retreat. As they made their way back to West Troy, they pondered their fates, and the friends and enemies they had so artfully acquired...
