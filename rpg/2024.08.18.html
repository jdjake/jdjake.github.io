  <h4> <b> Part 1: That Fearsome Hill of Stone </b> </h4>

  <p>
    In the borderlands lay a modest hamlet &mdash; a farming village called Bottomsworth, indistinguishable to many other villages in the realm, save for a cyclopean keep which loomed high above on a craggy hill. This keep had long been a source for fearsome fireside tales in the village; few of the village had even stepped within reach of the shadow of it's timeworn stone for fear of what horrors lay within.
  </p>

  <p>
    The peaceful rhythm of pastoral life was broken when peasants began to disappear from the village. First a man goes missing taking a drunken walk home alone on a moonless night. A night watchmen disappears next, their lantern found shattered upon the cobbled streets of the town. Terror grew as these disappearances became more frequent. Eventually, multiple villagers were vanishing each week. Farmers reported strange howls heard at night, seemingly coming from the ramparts of the keep. Then, one chilling night, a group of three-score villagers vanished. As a blood-red dawn rose over the hill of the keep, the town could not ignore their problem anymore, mustering a group of those brave enough to venture into the keep and rescue their kin from whatever doom befell them. These were the players of the adventure.
  </p>

  <p>
    So the party gathered beneath that ruined keep. Walls of toppled stone and colossal granite loomed above, jagged like the teeth of some unspeakable behemoth. Thorny vines weaved between the cracks in the wall. The air was filled with an eerie silence and a foul miasma of rot and decay. Rot-fattened flies buzzed ceaselessly, biting at the party, and small black insects choked the breath. The only sign that the party would find what they came for was a ragged banned atop the only surviving turret of the keep that hadn't collapsed into rubble, depicting a crimson skull on a black field.
  </p>




  <h4> <b> Part 2: The Shambling Dead and The Beasts Within </b> </h4>

  <p>
    The party began by surveying the keep. In the south, an old dirt road overrun with weeds and sickly vines lead to a dark, moss-eaten gatehouse, under which two corpses hung, strapped to poles. In the northwest, the ramparts had collapsed, it's stone blocks forming a precariously balanced rocky slope like a titan's game of dice. In the northeast, a vast, yawning sinkhole had devoured a wall and tower of the keep, along with a third of the inner courtyard of the keep.
  </p>

  <p>
    The group decided to start by surveying the sinkhole. Fearing further collapse, the group tied a rope to Heidi Coke the Smuggler, who carefully stepped over to the side of the hole. As Heidi came to the lip of the sinkhole, they had a horrible gut feeling that the earth was hollow beneath them, as if they were walking on a frozen lake. They dropped a candle off the edge, which fell for a while before being consumed by mist below. As Heidi lowered into the sinkhole, they were able to make out that the sides of the sinkhole indeed gave way to an unending darkness. To test the depth of the hole, Heidi dropped a lantern into the darkness. After ten seconds, a faint splash was heard from the bottom of the pit. With this knowledge, the group decided to try finding a safer way into the sinkhole through the keep.
  </p>

  <p>
    To get into the keep, the party decided to pass through the gatehouse. As they approached, they beheld with mounting horror the grim details of the bodies strapped to the poles. These poor souls were not bound by rope, but by sinuous vines that wormed grotesquely through eye sockets, ears, and gaping mouths. The figures were no strangers &mdash; they were Kieran and his younger brother Aidan, the blacksmith's two sons, who had vanished eleven days earlier. As the party recoiled, the corpses stirred, vines writhing as the corpses began to uncoil themselves from their perches. Piloting the corpses like puppets, the vines began shambling towards the party.
  </p>

  <p>
    The group fled in terror. Using the jangling bells of his hat, Johnson the jester managed to lead the pair of horrors away from the party, giving the rest of the party an opportunity to run through the gatehouse. In a final act of daring, Johsnon threw his hat towards a barren tree away from the path, drawing the creature's attention as he slipped past their grasp and into the keep.
  </p>

  <p>
    Meanwhile, the main party had ran through the gatehouse. They quickly assessed the courtyard of the keep, identifying the keep's sole surviving tower among the weeds and brambles as a likely source of the gate's mechanism, which they could use to save themselves from the viney terrors. They sprinted towards the weathered door of the tower. But the door refused entry, so that the group collided against one another. Their combined weight broke down the old door with a thunderous crash, and the group toppled into the tower, landing on a floor covered with ragged hides which permeated with the stench of rot.
  </p>

  <p>
    Johnson ran past the gates behind the party. As he passed underneath, a faint cackle was heard, and the gate started to descend above him. With a desparate dive, Johnson leapt through the gate, just as it slammed shut behind them. Meanwhile, in the keep's tower, snarling beasts emerged from the shadows of the room towards the rest of the party, the light revealing a jumble of incongruous features: receding lips curling back from saber-like fangs, cat-like eye slits, thick bristly fur, and simian snouts. Above these monsters, descending from the spiral staircase of the keep, a towering minotaur with thick, leathery skin and a large silver torc hung with bleached skulls, brandishing a huge jagged axe.
  </p>

  <p>
    The party tried to scramble back to the courtyard as the monsters charged, howling like beasts descending upon prey. The adventurers scattered, fighting desperately to avoid being surrounded. Blood fed the ground of the keep, with the party eventually being able to kill the beasts, but not before losing six of their own: Big Chances the Gambler, Gouda Chedder the Cheesemaker, Benadicta Pope the Herbalist, Cletus the Parsnip Farmer, Hubert Pemberton the Weaver, and Willy the orphan.
  </p>

  <p>
    During the fight, several fled for their lives over the collapsed wall - some made it over by sheer luck, but Dickerson the Elven Chandler wasn't so lucky, shifting the rocks, and causing the massive granite blocks to tumble down the slope. He was crushed under the rocks amidst choking dust and the deafening crash of stone against stone. The survivors who made it to the bottom of the hill discovered the landslide had unearthed a narrow, rocky shaft; the group squeezed through the narrow passage, hoping to hide from the beasts they ran from, but fled back when the saw the interior, an enormous stone door set in a portal, circumscribed in runes with a large pentagram at the center. These cowardly adventurers lived to fight another day.
  </p>

  <p>
    Perhaps seeking an upper hand, Bones Mcgee the Gravedigger approached an old well in the courtyard during the battle, albeit with cautious steps, having being warned by an old drunkard as they were leaving town to "Beware the Well! It has swallowed many a poor soul!". Mcgee laid down against the black stones from which the well was constructed, using a pocket mirror to stare into what lay below. Inside, a yawning darkness stretched before them. It seemed to stretch out and then retract before their eyes, and so Bones looked away, unwilling to play chicken with whatever horror lay within.
  </p>

  <p>
    After the fight, the party regrouped in the courtyard. Carefully, they approached the tower and took a closer look inside now the beasts had been dispatched with. Inside, they found their fellow countrymen, some hanging upside down from chains spiked through the ceiling, others manacled to the wall or tied up amongst bundles of rotting hides. All in all, there were about fifteen men, women, and children here, about half from the town. Those who were battle-ready decided to join the group, while the others remained in the courtyard resting, and looking after the kidnapped children.
