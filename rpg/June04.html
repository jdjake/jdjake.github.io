    <h1> Towards The Wavestone </h1>

  <h4> <b> Date: </b> June 4th, 2024 </h4>
  <h4> <b> Players: </b> Avi, Abe, Dan, Gary </h4>

  <br>

  <div>

  <h4> <b> Characters </b> </h4>
  <p>
    Avi played ?
  </p>
  <p>
    Abe played <em>Bep 'Gunpowder' Glover</em>, a Jesuit Monk based on the isle of Yuma. Known for his stench, the rotten teeth hanging out of his mouth, and his preference for alchohol.
  </p>
  <p>
    Dan played <em>Iago ‘Le Red Bird’</em>, a backstabbing rapscallion, a sailor with an insatiable urge for treasure. His previous adventures lead him to a narrow escape from a cannibalistic ending, but he never escaped <em>that smell</em>.
  </p>
  <p>
    Gary played <em>Annemicke 'Flatline' Hollegate</em>, a known pirate and heretic amongst the colonial powers of the Caribbean. He'd gained a knack for wilderness survival, even if it'd cost him his right eye in the process.
  </p>

  <h4> <b> BLAH </b> </h4>

  <ul>
    <li> You met Nerith, who was captured by some pirates. She warned you about some growing darkness gathering in the middle of the map. You released her back into the ocean. </li>
    <li> You confronted the owner of the Sultry Siren, Gibbons, who stole your stuff and gave it back (Abe feel free to get that stuff back. You intimidated him into give you your stuff back, as well as a conch that glowed a light blue and let out a soft rhyme when filled with water. </li>
    <li> You travelled out too Skeleton Cove island, passing an arch of hung men. You made anchor in a foggy, eerily silent bay, and made your way into the jungle. You find an stela with a carving of a black body enclosed within a space. Xoth found a giant mollusk in the mud by the rive descending from the waterfall. </li>
    <li> You found a cave inside a secret waterfall, after camping out the night. Xoth went in, and came back with a human arm. You passed through, with your lights off, where water ran down to a dark, undulating lake with ocean currents (Agility DR12 or D4 Damage), surrounding a perfectly rectangular, high-school sizes black (Basalt?) center. </li>
    <li> As you lit your torches, 3 leeches came creeping up on you. </li>
  </ul>
