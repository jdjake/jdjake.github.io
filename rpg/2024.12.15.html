  <h4> <b> Summary </b> </h4>

  <ul>
    <li> Destiny, Uriel, Grey, and Melissa are from a BIG family in a REALLY small town in Alabama … they think they're all related … probably </li>
    <li> Willow B. Hall is near Christmas Town. </li>
    <li> Willow B. Hall was a cultist meeting place. The cult was “The Circle of the Dark Moon”. Willow B. Hall holds a valuable relic: “The hand of Yid”. </li>
    <li> The adventurers - Patrick, Willie, and Flush - persuade Logart to join their party primarily with Willie's promises of sexual favors. </li>
    <li> The adventurers meet the Alabaman peasants on their way to claim the deed to Willow B. Hall and agree to party up. </li>
    <li> The adventurers go to bed in a tavern. They decide to share beds … to save money ;) </li>
    <li> They awaken to a crash and three rogues running through the streets toward Willow B. Hall. </li>
    <li> A giant man pursues the three rogues toward Willow B. Hall. He screams for “His Mildred!” He steals the bell of St. Olaf. The adventurers must recover the bell to save Christmas! </li>
    <li> The adventurers pursue the giant and the three rogues to Willow B. Hall. The giant is peering inside looking for the rogues! </li>
    <li> Willie immediately sneaks around the house taking advantage of when the giant is looking away. </li>
    <li> The giant is 30 feet tall, swings a church bell from a chain with great ease, and moves with great speed due to his enormous stride. </li>
    <li> The party enters through the back doors while the giant peers in through the front. </li>
    <li> The inside has an unlit fireplace with a mounted huge beaked eagle. The inside is full of hunting trophies. There is a huge stuffed trophy in the middle: a beaked creature with huge claws and the body of a bear. There's a chandelier of antlers above. </li>
    <li> The party splits up to search for clues. Half go east. Half go west. </li>
    <li> The party that went West finds a room full of weapons. The floorboards are creaky and the DM rolls dice a lot … The adventurers are okay so far. </li>
    <li> The party that went East finds a room full of carpet and tapestries depicting battles, hunting, gardens, and warriors being entombed (worth about 5 gold each). The party that went East decides to stab the carpet and rip one floorboard out to peer down below. They find nothing but foundation. </li>
    <li> The party that went West coincidentally GETS THE SAME IDEA. They check beneath and find a large open space. It's quite a drop and could be reached by rope. </li>
    <li> Logart and Patrick go to the West room with the rest of the party. Flush goes alone to 2 new rooms: The Kitchen and the main hall. The kitchen had cauldrons on the ceiling and the cabinets had silverware worth 10 gold. The main hall had 2 skeletons waltzing on a dining room table. </li>
    <li> Flush is spotted by the Giant through a window. He retreats to the rest of the party but is intercepted by the Giant’s finger in the tapestry room. He takes 2 damage. </li>
    <li> He hobbles into the room with the rest of the party and says there's some cool loot back from where he came as he clutches his ribs in pain. No one believes him. </li>
    <li> The party starts to descend into the area beneath the floorboards in the West room. </li>
    <li> Flush, Logart, and Willie stay down. The rest go back up in case of traps. </li>
    <li> Willie opens a tomb revealing a skeleton with armor in good condition. Willie takes the plate mail (+8 AC). The plate mail has an insignia of a crescent moon. He gives his old chain mail to Logart (+5 AC). </li>
    <li> Willie opens another tomb and finds a skeleton with more chain mail. This one has an insignia of thorns. Another tomb is opened with another skeleton with plate mail. This one has a chest plate with an insignia of broken chains. There is an aura of magic. The heroes open the last tomb that has plate mail with an insignia of fins and fish. Each plate mail is worth 1200 GP. </li>
    <li> The giant assaults the wooden house. It is being damaged but not as much as expected. The walls whisper. Three sets of footsteps approach the party - the thieves from earlier that started the whole quest! </li>
    <li> The thieves are: a tall guy who is balding, the second guy has a three musketeers hat, and a shorter lady. </li>
    <li> Destiny tells them to GTFO. This is her grandmother's house. </li>
    <li> The party confronts the adventurers. They stole Mildred, the Giant's pet goose. They have a scroll of teleportation. The goose honked exposing their theft. The goose might lay golden eggs. </li>
    <li> The party demands the adventurers give up their weapons. Tall, bald guy obliges bit the other two make a run for it. Willie shoots at them with a long bow performing a mighty deed while Patrick uses color spray on them, attempting to blind them. </li>
    <li> The party goes to the second floor </li>
    <li> Logart leads the way rushing through rooms, knocking over a candle on the way. There are 3 skeletons cleaning a dining hall with a large lit fire place. Patrick puts out the candle that Logart knocked over and the skeletons are relieved. Patrick asks them where the goose is and they point toward where Logart ran. </li>
    <li> Willie and Flush stroll around the second floor. </li>
    <li> Logart finds a room with a large harpsichord. </li>
    <li> Logart gets to the main hall on the first floor. A giant skeleton with smoking armor appears and announces that the skeletons, including the 2 waltzing on the table, must apprehend the intruders. He points at Logart. They rush toward Logart. </li>
    <li> Logart knocks aside both of the ballroom dancing skeletons with his dwarven war hanmer and shield. </li>
    <li> Patrick and Aldia enter the room with Logart. Aldia shoots the arm off of one of the knocked over skeletons. </li>
    <li> The Alabaman peasants, Willie, and Flush explore the second floor together at a casual pace. </li>
    <li> In the first room there are six paintings: 1.) A woman in a large, billowing dress, 2.) a city on fire, a 3.) forest at night, 4.) A tall life-size portrait of a man examining a piece of metal with occult instruments strewn around the desk 5.) A man standing in a boat 6.) ?. He looks like Destiny's grandfather. </li>
    <li> The Alabaman peasants, Willie, and Flush go east from the dining hall. They enter a bedroom. There is a large armoire with clothing but no jewelry. They enter another room with two beds and empty drawers. They enter a third room. The room looks the same as the previous one. The door slams shut behind them. They enter another door which opens to a balcony above the main hall. They see Logart, Aldia, and Patrick fighting the skeletons. </li>
    <li> The big skeleton’s armor has the crest of an eye with a circular pupil. The big skeleton critical fails on its first attack and kills the standing skeleton. The big skeleton appears to have an AC of 20. </li> 
    <li> Aldia rolls a Nat 20! She smashes the nose of the big, smoking, knight skeleton and deals 9 damage. </li>
    <li> Logart runs away from the skeleton taking 7 damage as he’s struck by the skeleton. </li>
    <li> Flush yells that fighting isn't worth it. The skeleton is slow - just run away. </li>
    <li> Aldia is struck by the skeleton’s next attack. The skeleton rolls a Nat 20 and deals 8 damage. Aldia is unconscious and in critical condition. </li> 
    <li> Logart exits the house and opens the door. He encounters the giant who asks for Mildred. Logart tells him Mildred is in the hall and he'll open the door. The giant reaches in, barely missing Uriel. The giant grabs the skeleton knight and crushed it. BIG PLAY. It is frustrated the goose is missing and angrily demands Logart enter the house to get the goose. </li>
    <li> Aldia is lucky! She recovers with disadvantage on future rolls. </li>
    <li> The party goes up the stairs and follows Flush west. Melissa is attacked by a creature from beneath the stairs case. It strikes twice for 4 damage knocking Melissa unconscious in critical condition. The monster has the body of a bear and the head of an eagle … we saw this strange creature somewhere before (a trophy in the main room). The party strikes it with arrows and stuffing comes out. It's the trophy animal!  </li>
    <li> Willie screams that they must recover Melissa's body for the 1200 GP plate mail! Flush seconds this. </li>
    <li> Logart suspects the monster is weak to flame since it's made of stuffing. Patrick attempts to throw a torch but fumbles, barely managing to not drop the torch. </li>
    <li> Logart puts a torch to the monster. It sets aflame and runs off, leaving Melissa's body behind. BIG PLAY. </li>
    <li> Melissa unfortunately dies of her wounds. The party recovers her armor and items. </li>
    <li> The party enters a new room on the second floor. In the center there is a hand in a glass case covered in tattoos. There's also a black sarcophagus. There's also a mummified head. </li>
    <li> Willie puts a head in the hand. It is the hand of Yid. </li>
    <li> The party opens the sarcophagus. The lid is heavy. It requires multiple party members. The smoked skeleton reforms within it and tells, “GET OUT INTRUDERS!!!” It attempts to grab Willie but misses. </li>
    <li> The party attempts to reseal the sarcophagus. Willie, Logart and an Alabaman peasants succeed. They succeed and the skeleton appears trapped. </li>
    <li> The party enters a new room. In the center there is a 5’ by 8’ mirror. There appears to be someone in there. </li>
    <li> There is a man in a mirror whose trying on a jacket. </li>
    <li> An Alabaman peasants look through a mirror and sees previously moth-eaten clothes turn well maintained. They see a butler. They attempt to communicate with the man in the mirror who appears to be Marcus. They say, “Marcus, we’re your grandchildren!” The man ignores them. </li>
    <li> The goose appears! </li>
    <li> The party decides not to chase but to try to attract it. Willie tries to speak goose. The goose approaches timidly and bites him dealing 2 damage. </li>
    <li> Patrick casts color spray blinding the goose. Logart and an Alabaman peasant hold the goose together. </li>
    <li> The party leaves to bring the goose to the giant. A short, ragged woman with a staff stands in their path telling: “Give me the goose!” The party initiates combat. </li>
    <li> Aldia slaughters the woman in one hit. Lol. </li>
    <li> The party returns the goose to the giant. He is ungrateful, but runs off leaving the party unharmed. He leaves the town bell behind. The party returns the bell and Christmas is saved! </li>
    <li> The party returns to the house which has caught fire … perhaps from a certain burning corpse. They return for loot! They grab the 6 expensive paintings (worth 400 GP each, 2400 GP total). Behind the portrait of Marcus (the Alabaman peasants’ grandfather) there was a secret room! It had alchemical equipment worth 500 GP. There was an unfinished alchemical symbol beneath a rug.  </li>
    <li> The party explores one of the last rooms they haven't explored on the second floor. It's a library! The party throws all the books out the window. They talk aloud as they open. The books are worth 5 GP each. 16 books were recovered for 80 GP total. </li>
    <li> The party returns to the North East corner of the first floor. The house is burning. They leave using a grappling hook. </li>
    <li> As the pillars of the house crash smoke and whispers emerge. The whispers stop once the 12th pillar brakes. </li>
    <li> The party receives 400 GP for returning the bell to the village. </li>
    <li> The party see a castle of smoke whisping away. It's the Giant's castle (like Jack and the Bean Stalk). </li>
    <li> The party apparently missed many secrets and loot in the castle including the roof. </li>
    <li> The staff item allows not losing a spell in the event of a failed spell check 3 times. </li>
    <li> The party finds 3 potions in a locked chest they recovered and busted open: Mercurium, Liquid Childhood, Gift of the Worm. </li>
    <li> In one of the recovered books it discusses that Yid was one of the servants of the Autarchy of there lands. </li>
