        </p>

        <h4> <b> Summary </b> </h4>

        <p>
          In a dusty hamlet in Alabama, Destiny, Uriel, Grey, and Melissa belonged to a sprawling family tree with roots so tangled they weren't sure who they were related to. Life was slow, dull, and predictable. Until one day, a letter arrived from a long distant relative, bequeathing the entirety of Willowby Hall, a manor just outside of Turnip Hill. And so they set off on the long journey to inherit their fortune.
        </p>

        <p>
          Meanwhile, Patrick, Willie, and Flush were also heading to Willoyby Hall. They had heard rumors of Willowby Hall &mdash; in it's golden days a retreat for The Circle of the Black Moon, a prestigious society of occultists. Valuable items and relics were rumored to have been collected by the society, including ornate vases from Yoon-Suin, and the hand of Yd, a Eunach manservant to the Great Autarch of far-off Quazzar. They convinced Logart to join, and also headed to the manor.
        </p>

        <p>
          As they made their way toward the mansion, they crossed paths with the deed-posessing peasants, and decided to team up. The adventurers bunked at a rickety tavern in Turnip Hill a few hours from Willowby manner, packed into beds together under the pretense of saving coin, and awoke to the sounds of chaos &mdash; crashing and yelling. Out the window, three rogues tore through the town square, hotly pursued by a thirty-foot-tall giant dressed only in an elegant silk bathrobe, in the direction of Willowby Manor. The enraged giant tore the church bell from it's steeple, brandishing it as a morning star at the adventurers.
        </p>

        <p>
          The bell, blessed by St. Olvard, foe of the undead, was much needed in Turnip Hill for the upcoming Yule celebrations. The party agreed to try and recover the bell and save Christmas!
        </p>

        <p>
          The party immediately headed off on the trail of the adventurers and the giant to Willowby Hall. In a clearing in the woods, with about 200 feet of open ground between the treeline, stood Willowby Manor. Stopped over the manor, the giant peered into the windows on the front of the manor, calling out for the rogues to come out and face him.
        </p>

        <p>
          As the giant peered through the front of the mansion, the party slunk around the back and entered the back door of the manor. Inside was a large hunting room. A musty smell of old leather, dust, and animal fur filled the room. Around a huge fireplace, the walls were covered with taxidermied animal and monster heads. Dominating the center of the room, a monstrous stuff creature which appeared to be the unholy love child of an eagle and a bear, reared up, beak mid-screech. A chandelier of antlers dangled ominously from the ceiling.
        </p>

        <p>
          The group split up, half trotting off east, the other west. Westward was an armory a room filled with swords, spears, axes, and halberts. The floor creaked under their feet, threatening to alarm the angry giant outside. Eastward was a room of carpeted floor, filled with tapestries depicting battles, hunting, gardens, and the entombment of warriors. The party that went East decided to stab through the carpet and rip through the floorboards to peer down below, but found nothing but foundation. On the other hand, the western party checked down below and found a large open space. A large drop, but one that could be safely reached with rope.
        </p>

        <p>
          Meanwhile, Flush peeked through a doorway past the tapestry room, finding a kitchen, where cauldrons hung from the ceiling like culinary chandeliers. He took a quick inventory of the silverware. Feeling emboldened, he then ventured into the main hall, where he was greeted by two skeletons elegantly waltzing atop a dining table, who soon stopped, embarrassed when they realized they were being observed.
        </p>

        <p>
          Ironically, Flush was also being observed, spotted by a very large, unfriendly eye peering through the kitchen window. He retreated back to the rest of the party, but was blocked by a colossal finger which pushed through into the tapestry room. Flush tried to dive past the finger, but was flicked hard enough to be sent staggering. Clutching his ribs, he informed Logart and Patrick of all the 'cool loot' he'd found. No one believed him. Not even a little.
        </p>

        <p>
          The western party descending into the area beneath the floorboards, a crypt filled with stone sarcophagi. Willie and Logar pushed with all their force to reveal four armored skeletons within, each with separate insignia: thorns and roses, fin-like patterns, a crescent moon, and broken chains.
        </p>

        <p>
          The giant, evidently tired of stooping through windows, changed tactics to a cruder approach. It swung St. Olaf's bell into Willowby Hall, tearing off chunks of wood. Across the house, whispers could be heard, expelled from the walls of Willowby Manor. Flush attempted to cast comprehend languages to understand the whispers, but the spell did not succeed.
        </p>

        <h4> <b> Chapter 2: Up The Staircase </b> </h4>

        <p>
          Up a staircase, the thieves reappeared. The party could now make out their details. One tall man, Helmet Halfsword, stood in rugged armor, a largebushy moustache, and a mullet growing from a balding head. A woman of average height with shifty eyes and straight blonde hair topped by a Cavalier hat stood, with a dagger in one hand, a hooked hand in the other. And another short woman with dark bushy hair stood, in an egg shaped hat and a black, ornate cape with a comedically oversized collar that went up her face, past her nose.
        </p>

        <p>
          "Get out of this house", Destiny announced, stepping forward with arms crossed. "This is my grandmother's house".
        </p>

        <p>
          The short woman responsed. "We apologize &mdash; this wasn't our plan at all. We'll be out of the house as soon as the giant problem is dealt with. The job was meant to be simple. We used a scroll of teleport to infiltrate the flying castle of a cloud giant while he was sleeping, and stole his most treasured possession: a goose, which rumor has it, lays golden eggs. We would have made it scott free, if that damnable goose hadn't begun honking and woke up the giant. We dived from the castle, and have been pursued ever since".
        </p>

        <p>
          Flush retorted: "The giant problem seems to have a simple solution then. Return the goose and he'll be on his way".
        </p>

        <p>
          "That's the problem. It might have gotten away from us in this house".
        </p>

        <p>
          The party demanded that until the goose was found, the others should surrender their weapons. The tall man, who introduced himself as Helmut Halfsword, handed over his broadsword. As he handed over his sword, the other two made a break for it down the corridor behind them.
        </p>

        <p>
          Willie notched his longbow, while Patrick unleashed a spray of colors, which together took down the blonde haired rogue. Logart chased after the final thief, barreling through rooms with all the grace of a charging rhinoceros. In his wake, a candle was knocked over, landing near three skeletons dutifully scrubbing down a dining hall. Before the whole place could go up in flames, Patrick swiftly extinguished it, earning what could only be described as relieved nods from the skeletal cleaners. Patrick asked where the woman ran to, and the skeletons pointed towards the main hall.
        </p>

        <p>
          Then things got worse. As Logart entered the main hall, a giant skeleton, clad in smoking armor, appeared on the opposite side of the main hall. It pointed at Logart and announced, in a deathly voice, that all skeletons &mdash; waltzing or otherwise &mdash; must apprehend the intruders.
        </p>

        <p>
          The two ballroom dancers from the kitchen ran into the main hall, lunging at Logart. Logart, unimpressed, raised his dwarven war hammer and shield, knocking them aside with one mighty blow. "Stick to dancing", he muttered. Alida then leveled her crossbow and fired at the skeletons on the floor.
        </p>

        <p>
          The imposing leader of the skeletons, clad in armor bearing the crest of an eye, slashing with a schimitar like weapon. It's first attack was clumsy enough to decapitate one of it's own skeletal minions, but the attacks of the skeleton were clearly powerful.
        </p>

        <p>
          Alida, sensing an opportunity, took a mighty swing at the knight’s nasal cavity, sending bone fragments flying, though the knight remained standing.
        </p>

        <p>
          Flush, who'd been watching the fight from the rear, cupped his hands to his mouth and yelled at the group. "The skeleton looks pretty cumbersome. It's slow! Maybe, just an idea &mdash; RUN AWAY!"
        </p>

        <p>
         Alida would have responded with something witty, but the skeleton knight, clearly having had quite enough of her, swung its weapon with unnerving precision, dealing a devastating blow that knocked her over. Aldia collapsed in a dramatically unconscious heap.
       </p>

       <p>
         Thinking outside the box. Logart opened the front door. The giant loomed outside &mdash; with hands that looked like they could probably arm-wrestle a mountain and win. It peered down at Logart and, with a shingle-shaking road, rumbled “Where’s Mildred!?”
       </p>

       <p>
        Logart gestured toward the house. “It's right inside. I’ll open the door.”
      </p>

      <p>
        The giant, apparently taking this as an invitation, reached in, narrowly missing the other members of the party, but succeeding in grabbing the skeleton knight. The knight flailed ineffectually before being unceremoniously crushed into a collection of dramatically useless bones.
      </p>

      <p>
        Realized it had been tricked, the giant angrily demanded Logart to get the goose for it. "No more games, or I'll gobble you up!" Logart dodged back into the house to get away.
      </p>

      <p>
        Alida came out of consciousness, miraculously surviving the deadly swing of the skeletal knight. Undeterred, her and the rest of the party ascended the central staircase in the great hall, where another of the taxidermied eagled beast stood watch. But as the group ascended, Alida was again attacked by something large, something vicious, something &mdash;
      </p>

      <p>
        "OH GODS, IT’S THE STUFFED THING FROM THE FIRST ROOM!"
      </p>

      <p>
        “WE HAVE TO SAVE MELISSA!” bellowed Willie, heroically. “SHE’S WEARING PLATE MAIL WORTH 1200 GOLD PIECES!”
      </p>

      <p>
        Flush, a scholar and a gentleman, nodded. “Can’t let good armor go to waste.”
      </p>

      <p>
        Logart squinted at the monstrous thing. “It’s made of stuffing, right?”
      </p>

      <p>
        Patrick, inspired, grabbed a torch and tried to throw it. Tried being the key word. His throw was... let’s call it ‘theoretical.’ The torch fumbled in his hands, and for a horrifying moment, it looked like he might just set himself on fire instead.
      </p>

      <p>
        Logart, deciding not to leave things to fate, took matters into his own hands and jammed his own torch into the creature’s hide.
      </p>

      <p>
        The result was immediate and spectacular. The monster went up like a dry haystack in a dragon’s sneeze, let out a noise somewhere between a screech and a whoopee cushion, and bolted down the hall, leaving a thick trail of burning fluff in its wake.
      </p>

      <p>
        The problem with old houses, Willie reflected, was that they were never just old houses. They were always a bit haunted, somewhat cursed, or structurally unsound in ways that involved large, angry skeletons.
      </p>

      <p>
        The party had just entered yet another dusty chamber on the second floor of this particular crumbling manor. In the center, encased in glass, sat a severed hand covered in intricate tattoos. Nearby, a black sarcophagus loomed ominously, as if it had been placed there with the sole purpose of being an ill-advised curiosity. Also present was a mummified head, because of course there was.
      </p>

      <p>
        Willie, never one to let caution get in the way of incredibly bad ideas, promptly grabbed the head and placed it in the hand. This, as it turned out, was the Hand of Yd. It did not shake hands in the traditional sense.
      </p>

      <p>
        Not to be outdone, the party then turned their attention to the sarcophagus. With much grunting and the combined effort of multiple adventurers and an enthusiastic Alabaman peasant (who had taken to adventuring like a duck to a particularly chaotic pond), the lid was pried open. Inside, a smoked skeleton—which was a very specific kind of undead—reformed itself and bellowed, “GET OUT, INTRUDERS!” before making an attempt at grabbing Willie. It missed, largely due to a combination of rusty reflexes and Willie’s well-honed survival instincts (which mostly consisted of dodging wildly and shrieking).
      </p>

      <p>
        Deciding that perhaps the skeleton ought to remain an unopened surprise, the party frantically slammed the lid shut again. Through sheer determination and a great deal of leaning, they managed to trap the creature once more. No doubt it would be very cross about the whole thing if it ever got out.
      </p>

      <p>
        Moving on, the party found themselves in yet another room—because old mansions never ran out of rooms. This one contained an enormous mirror. In it, they spotted a well-dressed man trying on a jacket, which was unusual because there was definitely no well-dressed man in the room with them. The Alabaman peasant peered closer and noticed that the threadbare clothes in the reflection appeared pristine. The man in the mirror, Marcus, was addressed as their grandfather, which he responded to by continuing to ignore them entirely.
      </p>

      <p>
        Then the goose appeared.
      </p>

      <p>
        Goose appearances were never to be taken lightly, particularly when the goose in question had a reputation. The party, showing unexpected restraint, decided not to chase it but instead to lure it over. Willie, emboldened by previous successes in poor decision-making, attempted to speak goose. The goose, unimpressed by Willie’s accent, responded by biting him. This was deemed an adequate response by all involved.
      </p>

      <p>
        Patrick, ever the problem solver, cast Color Spray, blinding the goose. Logart and the Alabaman peasant promptly tackled it, because when in doubt, wrestling poultry seemed the logical course of action.
      </p>

      <p>
        Triumphant, if slightly baffled, the party left to return the goose to its rightful owner: a giant. However, a short, ragged woman with a staff stood in their way, demanding, “Give me the goose!”
      </p>

      <p>
        Aldia, choosing efficiency over diplomacy, promptly struck the woman down in a single, swift blow. There was a moment of silence. Then someone muttered, “Well, that escalated quickly.”
      </p>

      <p>
        The party delivered the goose to the giant, who, being a giant, was spectacularly ungrateful and left without so much as a ‘thank you,’ abandoning the town bell in the process. The party, unimpressed but pragmatic, returned the bell to the village, thus saving Christmas (or at least a festival that was close enough to count).
      </p>

      <p>
        Returning to the mansion, they found it had caught fire—likely due to an earlier misadventure involving a burning corpse and poor fire safety protocols. Naturally, instead of leaving immediately, they ran back inside for loot. Six expensive paintings and a secret room later, they uncovered alchemical equipment, an unfinished alchemical symbol, and a locked chest containing potions with names so dramatic they should have come with a disclaimer: Mercurium, Liquid Childhood, and Gift of the Worm.
      </p>

      <p>
        Feeling the walls quite literally closing in, the party made their exit via grappling hook as the burning mansion collapsed behind them. With an air of ominous finality, whispers emerged from the smoke, only to abruptly cease when the twelfth pillar gave way. The party, having thoroughly ransacked the place, accepted 400 gold for returning the town bell and looked up to see the smoke forming a castle—presumably the giant’s. It was then they realized they had missed several secrets, many pieces of loot, and, notably, the roof.
      </p>

      <p>
        “Well,” said Logart, “guess we’re not going back now.”
      </p>

      <p>
        “Nope,” said Willie, nursing his goose bite.
      </p>

      <p>
        The party shrugged, divided the gold, and strolled off into the sunset, already half-planning their next terrible idea.
      </p>

      <p>
        With newfound riches and a few mysteries still lingering, the adventurers departed, richer in gold, bruises, and wholly unnecessary magical trinkets. The smoke rising from the ruins formed the shape of a castle in the sky—the giant’s home, now an empty throne above the land. There was more to this tale yet to be told, but for now, with their pockets full and Christmas miraculously intact, they headed toward the nearest tavern to drink, bicker, and, of course, plan their next grand heist.
      </p>
