        </p>

        <h4> <b> Chapter 1: The Road To Willowby Hall </b> </h4>

        <p>
          In a dusty hamlet in Baalmara, Destiny, Uriel, Grey, and Melissa belonged to a sprawling family tree with roots so tangled they weren't sure who they were related to. Life was slow, dull, and predictable. Until one day, a letter arrived from a long distant grandfather, bequeathing the entirety of Willowby Hall, a grand manor, to the family. And so they set off on the long journey to inherit their fortune.
        </p>

        <p>
          Meanwhile, Patrick, Willie, and Flush were also heading to Willowby Hall. They had heard rumors of the manor, in it's golden days a retreat for The Circle of the Black Moon, a prestigious society of occultists. Valuable items and relics were rumored to have been collected by the society, including ornate vases from Yoon-Suin, and the hand of Yd, a Eunach manservant to the Great Autarch of far-off Quaziir. They convinced Logart to join, and were thus also headed on the path to the manor.
        </p>

        <p>
          As the adventurers made their way toward the mansion, they crossed paths with the deed-posessing peasants, and decided to join forces. The adventurers bunked at a rickety tavern in Turnip Hill, an hour or so from Willowby manner, packed into beds together under the pretense of saving coin. They awoke to the sounds of chaos &mdash; crashing and yelling. Out the window, three rogues tore through the town square, hotly pursued by a thirty-foot-tall giant dressed only in an elegant silk bathrobe, in the direction of Willowby Manor. The enraged giant tore the church bell from it's steeple, brandishing it as a morning star at the adventurers.
        </p>

        <p>
          The bell, blessed by St. Olvard, great foe of the undead, and was much needed in Turnip Hill for the upcoming Yuletide celebrations. The party agreed to try and recover the bell, and save Christmas!
        </p>

        <p>
          The party immediately headed off on the trail of the adventurers and the giant to Willowby Hall. In a clearing in the woods, with about 200 feet of open ground between the treeline, stood Willowby Manor. Stooped over the manor, the giant peered into the windows, calling out in anger for the rogues to come out and face him.
        </p>

        <p>
          As the giant peered through the front of the mansion, the party slunk around and entered through the back door. Inside was a large hunting room. A musty smell of old leather, dust, and animal fur filled the room. Above a huge fireplace, the walls were covered with taxidermied animal and monster heads. Dominating the center of the room, a monstrous stuff creature, which appeared to be the unholy love child of an eagle and a bear, reared up, beak mid-screech. An intricate chandelier made from antlers dangled from the ceiling above.
        </p>

        <p>
          The group split up, half trotting off east, the other west. Westward was an armory, filled with swords, spears, axes, and halberts. The floor creaked under their feet, threatening to alarm the angry giant outside. Eastward was a room of carpeted floor, filled with tapestries depicting battles, hunting, gardens, and an entombment of a troupe of warriors. The party that went East decided to stab through the carpet and rip through the floorboards to peer down below, but found nothing but foundation. On the other hand, the western party checked down below and found a large open space. A large drop, but one that could be safely reached with rope.
        </p>

        <p>
          Meanwhile, Flush peeked through a doorway past the tapestry room, finding a kitchen, where cauldrons hung from the ceiling like culinary chandeliers. He took a quick inventory of the silverware. Feeling emboldened, he then ventured into the dining hall beyond, where he was greeted by two skeletons elegantly waltzing atop a dining table, who soon stopped, embarrassed when they realized they were being observed.
        </p>

        <p>
          Ironically, Flush was also being observed, spotted by a very large, unfriendly eye peering through the kitchen window. He retreated back to the rest of the party, but was blocked by a colossal finger which pushed through into the tapestry room. Flush tried to dive past the finger, but was flicked hard enough to be sent staggering. Clutching his ribs, he informed Logart and Patrick of all the 'cool loot' he'd found. No one believed him. Not even a little.
        </p>

        <p>
          The western party descended into the area beneath the floorboards, a crypt filled with stone sarcophagi. Willie and Logart pushed with all their force to reveal four armored skeletons within, each with separate insignia: thorns and roses, fin-like patterns, a crescent moon, and broken chains.
        </p>

        <p>
          The giant, evidently tired of stooping through windows, swapped it's tactics to a cruder approach. It swung St. Olvard's bell into Willowby Hall, tearing off chunks of wood. Across the house, whispers could be heard, expelled from the walls of Willowby Manor. Flush attempted to cast comprehend languages to understand the whispers, but the spell did not succeed.
        </p>

        <h4> <b> Chapter 2: Three Thieves and a Death Knight </b> </h4>

        <p>
          At the landing of a staircase, the thieves reappeared, and the party could make out the three: One tall man, Helmet Halfsword, stood in leather armor, a large, bushy moustache, and a mullet growing out from a balding head. A woman of average hat, Lisbet Grund, stared at the party with shifty eyes, with straight blonde hair topped by a Cavalier hat, a dagger in one hand, and a hook in place of the other. And the third thief was a short woman with dark bushy hair named Apocalypse Ann, in a hat that curved upward into an egg shape. Her black, ornate cape had a comedically oversized collar, that went up her face, past her nose.
        </p>

        <p>
          "Get out of this house", Destiny announced, stepping forward with arms crossed. "This house is my grandmothers".
        </p>

        <p>
          The short woman responsed. "We apologize &mdash; hiding here wasn't our plan at all. We'll be out of the house as soon as the giant problem is dealt with. The job was meant to be simple. We used a scroll of teleport to infiltrate the flying castle of a cloud giant while he was sleeping, and stole his most treasured possession: a goose, which rumor has it, lays golden eggs. We would have made it scott free, if that damnable goose hadn't begun honking. We dived from the castle, and the giant's been in hot pursuit ever since".
        </p>

        <p>
          Flush snorted: "The giant problem seems to have a simple solution then. Return the goose and he'll be on his way".
        </p>

        <p>
          "That's the problem. The damned goose got away from us as we entered the house".
        </p>

        <p>
          The party demanded that until the goose was found, the others should surrender their weapons. Helmut handed over his broadsword. Yet as he handed over his sword, the other two made a break for it down the corridor behind them.
        </p>

        <p>
          Willie notched his longbow, while Patrick unleashed a spray of colors, which took down the blonde haired rogue. Logart chased after the final thief, barreling through rooms with all the grace of a charging rhinoceros. In his wake, an arrangement of candles was knocked over, landing near three skeletons dutifully scrubbing down a dining hall. Before the whole place could go up in flames, Patrick swiftly stamped the fire out, earning what could only be described as relieved nods from the skeletal cleaners. Patrick asked where the woman ran to, and the skeletons pointed towards the main hall.
        </p>

        <p>
          Things soon got much worse. As Logart entered the main hall, a giant skeleton, clad in smoking armor, appeared on the opposite side of the main hall. It pointed at Logart and announced, in a deathly voice, that all skeletons &mdash; even the noncy waltzing kind &mdash; must apprehend the intruders.
        </p>

        <p>
          The two ballroom dancers were pushed from the kitchen into the main hall, lunging at Logart. Logart, unimpressed, raised his dwarven war hammer and shield, knocking them aside with one mighty blow. "Stick to dancing", he muttered. Alida then leveled her crossbow and fired at the skeletons who had fallen to the floor.
        </p>

        <p>
          The imposing leader of the skeletons, clad in armor bearing the crest of an eye, slashed with it's schimitar. Its first strike, wild and untempered, sheared through one of its own minions, sending a skull clattering to the bloodstained ground. Yet the attack revealed the brutal force behind each swing.
        </p>

        <p>
          Alida, sensing an opportunity, rushed forward and took a mighty swing at the knight’s nasal cavity, sending bone fragments flying, though the knight remained standing.
        </p>

        <p>
          Flush, who'd been watching the fight from the rear, cupped his hands to his mouth and yelled at the group. "The skeleton looks pretty cumbersome. It's slow! Maybe, just an idea &mdash; RUN AWAY!".
        </p>

        <p>
         Alida would have responded with something witty, but the skeleton knight, clearly having had quite enough of her, swung its weapon with unnerving precision, dealing a devastating blow that knocked her over. Aldia collapsed in a dramatically unconscious heap.
       </p>

       <p>
        Forced to think outside the box to give the party some relief, Logart opened the front door. The giant loomed outside &mdash; propped up with hands that looked like they could probably arm-wrestle a mountain and win. It peered down at Logart and, with a shingle-shaking road, rumbled “WHERE'S MILDRED!?”
       </p>

       <p>
        Logart gestured toward the house. “right inside. I’ll open the door wide for you.”
      </p>

      <p>
        The giant, taking this as an invitation, reached in, narrowly missing the other members of the party, but succeeding in grabbing the skeleton knight. The knight flailed ineffectually before being unceremoniously crushed into a collection of dramatically useless bones.
      </p>

      <p>
        Realized it had been tricked, the giant angrily demanded Logart to get the goose for it. "No more games, or I'll gobble you up!" Logart dodged back into the house to get away.
      </p>

      <h4> <b> Chapter 3: The Owlbear Returns </b> </h4>

      <p>
        Alida came out of consciousness, miraculously surviving the deadly swing of the skeletal knight. Undeterred, her and the rest of the party ascended the central staircase in the great hall. But as the group ascended, at the back of the party, Melissa was ambused by something large, something vicious, something &mdash;
      </p>

      <p>
        "OH GODS, IT’S THE STUFFED BEAR-THING FROM THE FIRST ROOM!"
      </p>

      <p>
        "We have to save Alida!" bellowed Willie, heroically.
      </p>

      <p>
        Flush, a scholar and a gentleman, nodded. "She's wearing some of the armor from the Crypt. Can’t let good armor go to waste".
      </p>

      <p>
        Logart squinted at the monstrous thing. “It’s made of stuffing, right?”
      </p>

      <p>
        Patrick, inspired, grabbed a torch and tried to throw it. Tried being the key word. The torch fumbled in his hands, and for a horrifying moment, it looked like he might just set himself on fire instead.
      </p>

      <p>
        Logart, deciding not to leave things to fate, took matters into his own hands and jammed his own torch into the creature’s hide.
      </p>

      <p>
        The result was immediate and spectacular. The monster went up like a dry haystack under a dragon’s sneeze, let out a noise somewhere between a screech and a whoopee cushion, and bolted down the hall, leaving a thick trail of burning fluff in its wake.
      </p>

      <p>
        The problem with old houses, Willie reflected, was that they were never <em>just</em> old houses. They were always a bit haunted and cursed.
      </p>

      <h4> <b> Chapter 4: The End of the Great Goose Chase </b> </h4>

      <p>
        The party entered yet another dusty chamber on the second floor of this particular crumbling manor. In the center, encased in glass, sat a severed hand covered in intricate tattoos stitched into each finger like rings. Nearby, a black sarcophagus loomed ominously, as if it had been placed there with the sole purpose of being an ill-advised curiosity. Also present was a mummified head, it's mouth filled with black-enamel teeth, because of course there was. Underneath, plaques identified the two treasures as "The Hand of Yd", and "The Mummified Head of the Great Autarch of Quaziir".
      </p>

      <p>
        Willie, never one to let caution get in the way of incredibly bad ideas, promptly grabbed the head and placed it in the hand. This unconventional handshake did not seem to reveal
      </p>

      <p>
        Not to be outdone, the party then turned their attention to the sarcophagus. With much grunting and the combined effort of multiple adventurers and an enthusiastic Melissa (who had taken to adventuring like a duck to a particularly chaotic pond), the lid was pried open. Inside lay a very familiar armored skeleton, faintly smoking. It bellowed, “Get out, intruders!” before making an attempt at grabbing Willie. Fortunately for Willie, the attack missed, largely due to a combination of rusty reflexes and Willie’s well-honed survival instincts (which mostly consisted of dodging wildly and shrieking). In response, the party frantically slammed the lid shut again.
      </p>

      <p>
        Moving on, the party found themselves in yet another room &mdash; because old mansions never ran out of rooms. This one contained an enormous mirror. In it, they spotted a well-dressed man trying on a jacket, which was unusual because there was definitely no well-dressed man in the room with them. The Baalmara peasant peered closer, and identified the man as a grandfather, yet much younger than the man. The group called out to the man, who appeared to ignore their shouting. Perhaps the mirror was a window into the past?
      </p>

      <p>
        Then the goose appeared.
      </p>

      <p>
        Goose appearances were never to be taken lightly, particularly when the goose had such a reputation. The party, showing unexpected restraint, decided not to chase it but instead to lure it over. Willie, emboldened by previous successes in poor decision-making, attempted to speak goose. The goose, unimpressed by Willie’s accent, responded by biting him. This was deemed an adequate response by all involved.
      </p>

      <p>
        Patrick, ever the problem solver, cast Color Spray, blinding the goose. Logart and the Balmaaran peasant promptly tackled it.
      </p>

      <p>
        Triumphant, the party left to return the goose to its rightful owner: a giant. However, on the landing above the main hall, the party encountered Apocalypse Ann again, demanding the group to “Give me that goose!”
      </p>

      <p>
        Alida, choosing efficiency over diplomacy, promptly struck the woman down in a single, swift blow. There was a moment of silence. Then someone muttered, “Well, that escalated quickly.”
      </p>

      <p>
        The party delivered the goose to the giant, who, being a giant, was spectacularly ungrateful and left without so much as a "thank you", abandoning the town bell in the process.
      </p>

      <h4> <b> Chapter 5: Looting The Manor </b> </h4>

      <p>
        Meanwhile, the mansion had begun to catch fire &mdash; likely due to an earlier misadventure involving a burning stuffed owlbear and poor fire safety protocols. Naturally, instead of leaving immediately, they dashed back upstairs to recover whatever loot they still could. Six expensive paintings and a secret room later, they uncovered alchemical equipment, an unfinished alchemical symbol, and a locked chest containing potions with names so dramatic they should have come with a disclaimer: Mercurium, Liquid Childhood, and Gift of the Worm.
      </p>

      <p>
        The party made then made their exit from the second floor via grappling hook, as the burning mansion collapsed around them them. With an air of ominous finality, the party observed the flames, as frantic chaotic whispers emerged from the burning remnants of the house.
      </p>

      <p>
        “Well,” said Logart, “guess we’re not going back now.”
      </p>

      <p>
        “Nope,” said Willie, nursing his goose bite.
      </p>

      <p>
        The party, having thoroughly ransacked the place, accepted 400 gold for returning the town bell and looked up to see the clouds above them briefly reveal a castle drifting off in the sky.
      </p>

      <p>
        The party shrugged, divided the gold and loot they had obtained, and strolled off into the sunset, already half-planning their next terrible idea.
      </p>
