  <div>

  </p>

  <p>

  </p>

  <p>

  </p>

  <h4> <b> Chapter 1: A Hunt In The Woods </b> </h4>

  <p>
    The road was old and windswept. For ten days the party had wandered through the desolate, cold, mist-laden moors of this swamp-country underneath the craggy peaks of the Trolltooth mountains.
  </p>

  <p>
    Flush to Willy: "You and that damned vision. There's no bear in sight. What I wouldn't do for a warm hearth and good company right now".
  </p>

  <p>
    Willy had a vision of a great bear far off in the wilderness, and had, with hope of making a warm winter cloak for the winters ahead. But it had been ten days, and there had been The party's only companions had been circling ravens, and the howl of distant wolves at night.
  </p>

  <p>
    Dawn was breaking, thin and pale. The men stirred, breaking their fast in uncomfortable silence, their breath misting in the chill. Then, on the road ahead, came a sound &mdash; muffled screams and the shuffle of countless feet. Through the mist, figures emerged, taking shape as they drew near.
  </p>

  <p>
    The group had not seen the party, who slipped into the trees flanking the road. They watched as the procession neared &mdash; a gathering of wretched souls, hollow-eyed and dirt-streaked, bearing crude weapons of wood and rusted iron. Axes meant for splitting wood, pitchforks for tilling earth. The people bore a terrible weight in their step, their faces carved from sorrow and dread.
  </p>

  <p>
    Before them stumbled a woman, her hair raven-dark, her mouth bound with rough cloth, struggling and squirming as she fought the mob with every step. A rope wound cruelly about her arms, held tight in the grip of a bearded man who averted his gaze. He did not relish this burden.
  </p>

  <p>
    Behind them rode eight warriors astride armored warhorses, their armor dulled by mist. Wolves rampant adorned their breastplates &mdash; fangs bared, claws rending. Cloaks of wolf-pelt draped over broad shoulders, their riders still and grim, watching their unwilling charge with an air of cold authority.
  </p>

  <p>
    The company watched from the trees, silent as hunters. The air was thick with portent. The woman was no mere captive, not a simple thief or wrongdoer bound for common justice. Something darker clung to this procession.
  </p>

  <p>
    Flush whispered to the others: "A witch’s doom?"
  </p>

  <p>
    Willy tightened the grip upon his blade. “Not all who burn are wicked.”
  </p>

  <p>
    Patrick responded: "Regardless. Perhaps we can steal some horses while they're distracted?"
  </p>

  <p>
    They let the host pass, shadows in the wood, unseen and silent. But their course had changed. They would follow.
  </p>

  <h4> <b> Chapter 2: The Ancient Standing Stones </b> </h4>

  <p>
    The procession trudged up a rocky slope to a craggy bluff, the wind keening through gnarled, ancient standing stones. At the centre was a squat stone altar, its surface slick with coagulated blood, four holes bored into the stone and looped with thick crude shackles of rope. Four ravens perched atop the stones, their beaks tearing through trails of gore.
  </p>

  <p>
    The eyes of the peasants were hollow with dread. The people did not wish to do this thing &mdash; but they had done it before, and they would do it again.
  </p>

  <p>
    Among the warriors strode a brute of a man, broad as an ox and weathered by the years. A scar split his face from brow to jaw, a relic of battles fought in the name of survival. His eyes, hard as flint, swept the gathering warily.
  </p>

  <p>
    Flush disguised himself as an old man, putting his hood over his face and bending over, hoping the shifting mist would aid the crude disguise. He stepped forth from the shadowed boughs of the forest’s edge, and talked to a woman among the peasants, in rasping voice.
  </p>

  <p>
    "A sorrowful day, this is. Tell me, why must the young one be chained?"
  </p>

  <p>
    "The howls, stranger. Have you not heard them? The beast that haunts the night? This wards it off"
  </p>

  <p>
    The hooded man tilted his head. "A beast, is it? And so you sate its hunger with your own kin?"
  </p>

  <p>
    "Better one than all," the woman murmured, eyes cast downward. A sacrifice a day, and the beast is sated. We draw lots &mdash; it's grim work, but fair.
  </p>

  <p>
    A scoff. "Cowards' reasoning."
  </p>

  <p>
    A hush fell over the gathered, heavy as storm-laden skies. The scarred man, the leader, turned, his eyes narrowing. "Who are you to speak of cowardice, wanderer?"
  </p>

  <p>
    The hooded man merely smiled, the gesture unseen beneath his cowl. "An old hermit of the wilds. I have no name. I see you wear the chains of fear gladly. A man does not bargain with the dark. In my day, men used to fight beasts like these".
  </p>

  <p>
    A hush. The leader’s jaw tightened. "You know nothing of the troubles we have here, old codger. Be on your way."
  </p>

  <p>
    Willy, sensing the tension in the air, emerged from the treeline. "Herpsy! There you are! Terribly sorry, sir. This is my Grandfather. He's not well in the head. He wanders off."
  </p>

  <p>
    Flush, catching on to the ploy, started barking madly, like a dog. The peasants, seeing Willy's wild eye and plate armor, shrank back, whispering amongst themselves in both fear and awe. 
  </p>

  <p>
    Flush, improvising, proclaimed "I volunteer in the young madam's place".
  </p>

  <p>
    The leader studied the stranger a moment longer before his hand left his sword hilt. "Fair enough. If you would take her place, so be it. May the gods make your death a painless one".
  </p>

  <p>
    The woman's bounds were freed, and she scrambled away, whispering frantic prayers of thanks. The old man moved to the stone, settling himself upon it as if taking a throne. The ropes were drawn tight around his limbs, but he did not flinch.
  </p>

  <p>
    Meanwhile, Willy turned to the leader. "Why haven't you slain the beast"?
  </p>

  <p>
    "The beast cannot be killed. By mortal weapons at least. By spear or by axe. The beast cannot be harmed. I used to have ten Thanes until we fought the beast. Now I am lucky to have seven."
  </p>

  <p>
    One of the warriors on horseback came forward. "If I may add, Jarl. It is a foul creature. It seems to descend out of the mist itself. We barely got away. We ran through a patch of wolfsbane, and the beast didn't seem to want to follow us through it."
  </p>

  <p>
    The leader continued: "We do not have enough of our number to risk fighting the beast again. This solution buys us time. Fortunately, a seer has come to our town. Hopefully he will be able to find a solution before it is too late".
  </p>

  <p>
    How long have you kept counsel with this seer?” Willy demanded.
  </p>

  <p>
    The Jarl responded: "He came from the woods", he muttered. "Wandered in like the wind. No home, no kin. But he has wisdom beyond reckoning". He nodded, more for his own sake than yours.
  </p>

  <p>
    A scoff rose from Willy and Flush.
  </p>

  <p>
    The Jarl frowned but said nothing. "Enough of this. We must return to Hirot and make preparations for night".
  </p>

  <p>
    The party watched the Jarl, his men, and the villagers as the mist swallowed them back up, saying nothing. Patrick emerged from his hiding place in the woods.
  </p>

  <p>
    "So they bound Flush &mdash; let's at least relieve him of his gold before he dies".
  </p>

  <p>
    "You can try", Flush warned. "I can probably still cast flaming hands. Anyway, I'm not staying here. Free me from this plinth".
  </p>

  <p>
    Then Willy and Patrick removed Flush's simple rope bindings, and Flush then removed his disguise. "I'll just pretend to be another member of your family now. Let's follow the townsfolk back to Hirot".
  </p>

  <h4> <b> Chapter 3: Hirot </b> </h4>

  <p>
    The wooded moors gave way to mist-laden fields, barren, crops withered from lack of light. Ahead, up the narrow track, lay the village of Hirot, defended by a low earthern rampart topped with a wooden palisade. Behind the vllage, a causeway rises to a great hall resting atop a ridge. Black hearth-smoke hangs forlornly over the village, as if even the smoke were too frightened to venture beyond the village walls.
  </p>

  <p>
    Two soldiers stood upon the ramparts. As the party approached, one raised a horn to his lips and loosed a mournful note, long and low, echoing over the empty fields. The gates creaked as they were drawn apart, revealing the streets beyond. Fires flickered in iron braziers, warding off both shadow and the unspoken dread that gripped the town like a vice. As the party entered, one guard spoke to the party:
  </p>

  <p>
    "Come in quick. The gates close at dusk. They do not open again until dawn. The hound is near. We keep watch. We do not invite death inside".
  </p>

  <p>
    The other asked "Do you have any news from the outside world? It's been so long since we've heard anything".
  </p>

  <p>
    "The mushrooms in the forest grow well this season".
  </p>

  <p>
    The first guard scoffed, shaking his head. "Aye, tis moist enough for it. The mist &mdash; it never clears. It clings to the bones of this place like glue."
  </p>

  <p>
    The travelers entered in silence, their presence acknowledged only by wary nods and the rustling of cloaks against the wind. The city was hushed, its people shuttered behind heavy doors, whispering prayers to gods who seldom answered. Willy turned to Patrick and muttered "They cower within walls of timber and thatch, yet the beast hunts in mist and shadow. No gate will hold it back".
  </p>

  <p>
    The party was naturally lead through the streets of Hirot to the townsquare. At the heart of the village loomed an inn, its heavy wooden doors reinforced with thick iron bars. Above the door, carved into old wood, a sign bore the emblem of a spear tipped with the huge fang of a beast. The Wolfspear Inn.
  </p>

  <p>
    Brogan, the keeper, met them at the threshold, his eyes sharp with the weight of responsibility.
  </p>

  <p>
    "You're the ones who saved my girl".
  </p>

  <p>
    Flush nodded. "She lives".
  </p>

  <p>
    Brogan clapped him hard on the shoulder. "Then you eat, drink, and sleep here for free. I thought my daughter was lost".
  </p>

  <p>
    The party was brought into a common room, where some peasants had already started laying out straw to sleep on the floor below. As they sat at the long, splintered table, Willy turned to the girl who had almost been sacrificed, Morgan, who nursed the bruises where the bindings had been tightened. "My grandfather gave his life for yours. Why did your father not take your place?"
  </p>

  <p>
    "My father fought for me. But when the time came..." She swallowed, throat tight. "He could not make the choice. We are all so afraid. The creature does not merely kill. It flays. It takes its time to kill. We have to gag those we sacrifice, or we'd never get any sleep for the screams".
  </p>

  <p>
    Outside, in the dusk, a howl rose. It was not the cry of any wolf.
  </p>

  <p>
    "Is yuor mother here?", Willy asked.
  </p>

  <p>
    She hesitated. “Long, long gone".
  </p>

  <p>
    "And a husband?"
  </p>

  <p>
    After a pause, she shook her head. "No. No husband". A pause. Her fingers curled slightly against the ri of her cup.
  </p>

  <p>
    Flush turned to the rest of the peasants. "Wh do you sleep here".
  </p>

  <p>
    "The beast comes in the dead of night. The first few nights, it dragged our kin straight from their beds into the dark. Now, we know better. We hide. Board our doors. Safety in numbers. Pray to gods who do not listen."
  </p>

  <p>
    "How does it enter?"
  </p>

  <p>
    "It simply appear out of nowhere. Shadow given form. It tears and rends, then vanishes."
  </p>

  <p>
    The wizard grunted. "And it leaves the bodies?"
  </p>

  <p>
    The gaunt man nodded, his face ashen. "Aye. Scattered in pieces. Seems to eat nothing. Like a feast unfinished."
  </p>

  <p>
    A peasant at the back of the room, swaddled in filthy wool, clutched a small flask. “I keep lamb’s blood in here”, he muttered. "If the beast attack, I'll fling it to the ground, and hope the beast will take it instead."
  </p>

  <p>
    Another man, reeking of stale ale, perked up. “I cover myself in hay while I sleep! Hope that'll fool the beast".
  </p>

  <p>
    Willy tapped a scarred finger against the bar. "And the Jarl? What does he say?"
  </p>

  <p>
    A murmur passed through the gathered peasants. The gaunt man licked his lips. "The Jarl listens to the seer. Always whispering at his side. It is he who runs the lottery."
  </p>

  <p>
    The warrior’s expression did not change. "Lottery?"
  </p>

  <p> "For the sacrifice. Each morning, a name is drawn. A life given to the dark."
  </p>

  <p>
    And this seer &mdash; when did he arrive?"
  </p>

  <p>
    "Two months past".
  </p>

  <p>
    "And the beast?"
  </p>

  <p>
    "One month past".
  </p>

  <p>
    The warrior exhaled through his nose. "Convenient."
  </p>

  <p>
    The tavern door burst open. A man, clad in colored fabric, staggered in, a small stringed instrument strappd to his back. "Morgan!" he cried, his voice breaking. "You live!" He rushed to the woman’s side, embracing her, fingers clinging as if to a dream.
  </p>

  <p>
    The warrior watched with quiet amusement. "No husband yet, I suppose."
  </p>

  <p>
    The warrior leaned back, surveying the room. Above the fire, a great spear hung, tipped with a huge fang like that on the sign of the inn &mdash; sadly, it was wood painted blue-silver rather than the real deal. A symbol of strength that would shatter in a real battle.
  </p>

  <h4> <b> Chapter 4: The Mad Widow Ymae </b> </h4>

  <p>
    Hoping to explore before night truly began, Patrick asked the peasants what there was to do in town.
  </p>

  <p>
    "The hound is loose tonight," murmured a bearded man, his voice low with superstition. "None with sense walk the streets past dusk."
  </p>

  <p>
    Another, a wiry man with a scar across his brow, nodded. "Aye, safer within these walls. The Jarl's house stands atop the hill, but even they bar their doors before dark."
  </p>

  <p>
    At a nearby table, a band of travelers listened. One, clad in a cloak dark as a raven's wing, leaned forward. "The Jarl's hall &mdash; what lies within?"
  </p>

  <p>
    "More than we’ll ever see," the bearded man grunted. "Peasants like us, we're not welcome there."
  </p>

  <p>
    A minstrel tuned his lyre in the corner, plucking at the strings with calloused fingers. His song was yet to begin, but the tension in the room made the silence heavy. The firelight flickered against the rough-hewn beams, casting uneasy shadows.
  </p>

  <p>
    A woman, her voice hushed, spoke from across the room. "There is one place you must not go. Ymae's hovel. A witch dwells there."
  </p>

  <p>
    At that, several men muttered prayers, eyes flicking toward the rafters as though afraid to summon her name.
  </p>

  <p>
    "No curse has fallen upon me yet," the cloaked traveler said, smirking. "Perhaps she is nothing more than an old woman."
  </p>

  <p>
    "Mock her if you will," the woman said, her face pale, "but those who cross her path bear misfortune. It is said her hut is woven from the bones of those who defied her."
  </p>

  <p>
    A companion of the cloaked man rose. "Sounds like something to see for ourselves".
  </p>

  <p>
    But the wanderer merely pulled his cloak tight, stepping out into the bitter dark. His boots echoed upon the empty streets, the silence around him deeper than any he'd known. The village cowered in fear, doors barred and windows shut against what lurked in the blackness.
  </p>

  <p>
    The houses of Hirot thinned out at the outskirts of town, around Ymae's hovel, as if repelled by the house, pressed against the trees. Twisted branches clawed the sky above it, and the thatch of its roof was blackened with age. Patrick knocked three times on the front door.
  </p>

  <p>
    A voice rasped from within. "Come in! Come in!"
  </p>

  <p>
    Patrick hesitated, before pushing the doom open and stepping into the strange interior. Despite it's humble outer appearance, the cottage seemed impossibly large. A fire roared in the center of the room, crackling and spitting flames that cast wild shadows upon the shelvers, where odd relics and jars of strange substances lined the walls. A black cat, mangy and thin, watched with knowing eyes from the top of the shelf.
  </p>

  <p>
    The old woman herself was hunched over, her gnarled hands working a spindle. The threads, golden and flaming, entered the spindle from the fire below. Her eyes gleamed with an unsettling knowing as she glanced up at the travelers.
  </p>

  <p>
    "You don’t look like the simpletons around here," she remarked with a thin smile, her voice rasping like dry leaves. "Come, sit by the fire. It’ll be dark soon. The beast will be here soon."
  </p>

  <p>
    Patrick and Willy glanced at each other uncertainly, but didn't know how to argue against the woman. They sat, as the fire flickered and danced in the hearth.
  </p>

  <p>
    Ymae giggled: "You fear me. I've always been here, the townsfolk have known me all their lives, and have all grown up to fear me. The children, they dare each other to get within eyesight of my window, but they're no bother beyond that. And I like to stick to myself, so it's not bother. But you're from out of time. You're not simpletons. You have no reason to fear me. I'm not the cause of the hound".
  </p>

  <p>
    Old May’s voice shrank low, almost a whisper. "The hound, you see, it’s not like other creatures. It’s a thing of nightmares. Born from the darkest shadows, a curse unleashed upon this cursed land. It comes at night, howling for blood, its eyes like burning embers. And we—" She gestured to the room around them, "—we are safe here. I've enchanter the walls. I have the hairs. They protect us. The beast cannot enter."
  </p>

  <p>
    The wind howled again, and from outside, came the sound of something prowling—heavy, deliberate steps that rattled the earth itself. The beast had come.
  </p>

  <p>
    Willy spoke, "What hair?"
  </p>

  <p>
    "The hair of the dead of course. When I caught wind of the beast, I weaved it into my thatched roof. The beast can't pass through."
  </p>

  <p>
    "Where did you get the hair".
  </p>

  <p>
    The old woman smiled a toothless grin. Ohhh &mdash; the mad witch Ymae has her ways.
  </p>

  <p>
    "Can you make something to protect me from the beast".
  </p>

  <p>
    "That and more. But you'd have to make a promise", she croaked.
  </p>

  <p>
    Outside, the night was alive with the sounds of death—screams and the unholy tearing of flesh echoed through the village.
  </p>

  <p>
    "You want a promise?" he asked, his voice low, thick with suspicion. "What kind of promise do you ask?"
  </p>

  <p>
    She did not answer immediately, her wrinkled hands pausing over the work. The crackle of fire was the only sound between them for a moment, as though the room itself held its breath. Finally, the woman spoke, her voice soft yet laden with hunger, "A promise that you will find me a husband. A man who will tend to my needs when I am too old to crawl to the hearth."
  </p>

  <p>
    Her words were strange, unsettling in their desperation. The warrior’s brow furrowed. The blood of men and beasts alike ran in the streets outside, yet this woman, this crone, cared only for companionship. His thoughts turned to the gnashing, the bloodshed he’d heard from the shadows of the dark.
  </p>

  <p>
    "I cannot bring you a husband," he said flatly, "not while death stalks these lands."
  </p>

  <p>
    The woman’s eyes flickered with something ancient, something dark. "Then I suppose you will not have the magic you seek.
  </p>

  <p>
    A moment of silence passed. The warrior’s eyes narrowed. What was it about her? Was she truly as harmless as she appeared, or was there some deeper darkness hiding beneath her brittle shell? Her words lingered, pulling at him like a thread unraveling in the winds of an old curse. And yet, despite the wariness clawing at his gut, he felt the odd weight of her request settle on his shoulders.
  </p>

  <p>
    "Stay the night darlings. Keep warm around the fire", Ymae said.
  </p>

  <h4> <b> Chapter 5: The Next Morning </b> </h4>

  <p>
    The cold light of a misty dawn broke over the desolate village, casting long shadows across the bloodied streets. A bitter wind stirred the remnants of a night’s horrors—bodies, shredded and scattered, now merely a grisly smear across the town square. The air carried the metallic scent of blood, thick and unyielding, clinging to the old stones like a curse. The bell rang again, its toll echoing across the empty homes, a summons that pulled reluctant souls from their meager sleep.
  </p>

  <p>
    Within the walls of the inn, Flush awoke to the ringing of a bell. He rushed outward. The blood ran in rivers through the streets, seeping into the dirt. Gutted entrails, remnants of flesh, and dismembered limbs lay scattered like refuse from some foul ritual. No one had been sacrificed at the standing stones. And this was the result.
  </p>

  <p>
    Flush, grim in his resolve, stepped forward. With an empty, weathered bag in hand, he began collecting body parts from the streets. If he arranged the parts around the standing stone, he might be able to trick the village into thinking there was still a sacrifice. He then jumped the wall of the keep, and headed to the stones.
  </p>

  <p>
    Meanwhile, Willy and Patrick awoke in the witches house, and followed the bell ringing to the town square. The morning air was biting.
  </p>

  <p>
    The Jarl was in the town square, of course. He stood tall, a towering figure, draped in furs. Beside him stood a wretch of a man, ringing the bell. Willy decided to observe what was happening, while Patrick decided to attempt to sneak into the Jarl's hall while everyone was preoccupied.
  </p>

  <p>
    "Jarl", Willy called out, his voice cutting through the hum of the crowd. The Jarl turned, his eyes narrowing as he regarded the strangers with suspicion.
  </p>

  <p>
    "I thought you left us" the Jarl replied. "It looks like your grandfathers death was in vain. And now we've lost our leather worker, our smith, and our baker. Perhaps only members of our own village can be sacrificed".
  </p>

  <p>
    The adventurers exchanged a glance. “How does this lottery work?” Willy asked.
  </p>

  <p>
    The wretch by the Jarl tolled the bell once more. Sylle Ru, the seer of the village. As the adventurers looked around, they saw the faces of the villagers &mdash; hollow-eyed, resigned to their fate. The time for sacrifice was fast approaching.
  </p>

  <p>
    Two scrawny figures, their flesh marked by vicious scars, stepped forward with whips in hand. Their eyes gleamed with an unnatural fervor, their hands trembling in anticipation. The whip cracked, its sound like the roar of an unseen beast, as a priest, a man draped in tattered robes, shouted from behind. "Repent! The end times are upon us. The Hound, the great beast, demands blood! It is sin that calls the Hound, and sin that binds us all."
  </p>

  <p>
    The wretch blindfolded the Jarl, now standing in the center of the town square. Around him, the peasantry gathered, their hearts heavy with dread, their eyes flicking nervously to the shadows.
  </p>

  <p>
    The blindfolded Jarl felt the worn surface of the key that had been pulled from the lockbox. His hands trembled as they grasped the piece of parchment inside. "Broegan" he read, his voice a hollow echo. The name was spoken with finality, but not with triumph.
  </div>

  <p>
    From the crowd, a murmur rose — fear and disbelief choked the air as Broegan, a stout man with graying hair and a worn apron, was shoved toward the center. His eyes darted, his hands raised in protest, but there was no escape. The crowd, as ever, was eager to offer him up. The sacrifice was coming, and they were no strangers to the taste of blood.
  </p>

  <p>
    Behind the Jarl’s back, the priest continued his chanting. The rest of the peasants made preparations to head to the sacrifice.
  </p>

  <h4> <b> Chapter 6: Robbing The Hall </b> </h4>

  <p>
    Patrick's eyes flicked toward the great hall looming above the town, a structure as ancient and decayed as the town itself. The golden straw roof, now faded and sagging, seemed to mock the very nature of the land. He could see guards moving, but there were no others—no priests, no others like those assembled for the sacrifice. It seemed strange to him, and that strangeness gnawed at him like the hunger of the beast that lurked beyond.
  </p>

  <p>
    Without a word, Kaldric turned and slipped into the shadows, his feet silent on the cobblestones. There was no time to waste. The great hall had windows, and with a whispered incantation, he summoned his unnatural ability to scale walls, his fingers curling as he clung to the stone like a spider.
  </p>

  <p>
    The night air was thick with the scent of burning wood, the sacrifice of the innocent spilling into the earth. Kaldric's heart pounded in his chest as he reached the top of the great hall, his fingers finding purchase in the cracked hay that lined the roof. Beneath him, he heard the sound of the crowd, chanting and wailing, a funeral dirge for the souls they would sacrifice.
  </p>

  <p>
    A sharp crack sounded behind him. Kaldric turned to see the town's bodies—those who had already been claimed—carried up the hill toward the cremation pyre. The guards, grim and silent, hauled the dead toward their fiery end, their faces empty of all emotion. It was not just a sacrifice of flesh. The town had sacrificed its soul long ago.
  </p>

  <p>
    Kaldric’s lips parted in a whisper of an ancient curse. His mind burned with the knowledge that if the keep above was left unchallenged, all would be lost. He could not—would not—let this madness continue. The beast, the Hound, was but a shadow of the true evil that had festered in Erenhold’s heart.
  </p>

  <p>
    Inside the yawning shadow of the mead hall, a dim torchlight flickered and swayed, casting long, quivering shadows across the damp stone walls. The air reeked of stale ale, sweat, and the sour scent of too many men packed into too small a space. There were benches, worn and crooked, around tables cluttered with empty drinking horns and smashed casks, some still spilling their sticky contents onto the rough-hewn floor.
  </p>

  <p>
    Patrick, his calloused feet bare against the cold mud, crouched at the edge of the hall. He had cast aside his boots, feeling the suck of the earth as he steadied himself. His muscles tensed, coiling like a serpent ready to strike, as he climbed with the grace of a panther. His fingers, slick with the grime of the place, found purchase on the rotting timbers of the structure, his feet pressing against the stone as he pulled himself upward.
  </p>

  <p>
    The wind had shifted, bringing with it the scent of meat and wine from some distant feast, but Faldar’s mind was sharp, focused only on the task at hand. His fingers were sticky, adhering to the wall with unnatural ease, as though some dark blessing had been bestowed upon him by powers older than time. He scaled the wall silently, the whispers of the world around him lost to the pulse of blood in his ears.
  </p>

  <p>
    Up above, the rafters groaned under the weight of years, old beams creaking as if the spirits of the dead themselves were watching his every move. Faldar’s eyes narrowed as he passed through the hay-covered loft, brushing his fingers over the ancient timbers that had borne the weight of countless men and gods. He moved swiftly, silently, an intruder in the home of giants.
  </p>

  <p>
    The hall below him sprawled like the belly of a beast, open and dark. He could see the yawl’s throne—a massive, ornate chair set against the far wall, carved from black stone and inlaid with silver runes of power. A few scattered guards stood watch, their attention lax, their gaze drifting, oblivious to the danger above.
  </p>

  <p>
    Faldar’s heart raced with anticipation. He dropped into the hall, silent as death itself, and moved toward the benches, eyes scanning for anything of value. Among the discarded cups and broken horns, a glint of silver caught his eye—an ornate drinking horn, chased with delicate patterns of silver and platinum. His fingers twitched with desire.
  </p>

  <p>
    A sound echoed from the far side of the room—a muffled clink of metal. The guards had noticed the faint tremor in the air, the soft disturbance in the balance of things. A shadow moved toward the spilled mead, and Faldar’s breath caught in his throat. He could not afford to be seen. The guards were close now, and the hall grew smaller, suffocating in its weight.
  </p>

  <p>
    Without a moment's hesitation, Faldar turned and bolted toward the far door, his feet barely touching the ground. The wind howled louder as he raced through the hall, his body a blur of shadow and motion. He reached the first door, pulling it open with a quiet groan. Inside, the room was dark, the air thick with the stench of unwashed bodies. Bunks lined the walls, each one a grave waiting to be filled. Weapons—swords, spears, and shields—littered the floor, abandoned by their owners in a haze of drunken stupor.
  </p>

  <p>
    Faldar’s eyes narrowed as he scanned the room. He could hear the faint shuffle of feet outside. The guards were coming closer. His mind raced—he needed to move, to act. He dropped to his knees beside the nearest sword, its hilt cold and familiar in his grasp. The room smelled of sweat, iron, and the promise of violence.
  </p>

  <p>
    There was no time for hesitation. Faldar rose swiftly, his heart hammering in his chest. The next door beckoned, but it was only a heartbeat away from discovery. As his hand grasped the cold iron of the next door, he heard the unmistakable sound of a guard’s boots on the wooden floor outside.
  </p>

  <p>
    Faldar’s heart skipped a beat. The chase had begun.
  </p>

  <p>
    In the dying light of the afternoon, the narrow alleyways of the crumbling city twisted like the insidious coils of a serpent, ever-threatening to choke those who dared to tread upon them. The stench of death and decay hung thick in the air, but it was not the smell of the forgotten dead that filled the hearts of those in the shadows—it was the unmistakable scent of danger.
  </p>

  <p>
    High above, atop the shattered roof of a once-proud structure, a lone figure crouched, the tips of his fingers brushed lightly against the jagged stone as he silently moved, slipping into the darkened slit that had once been a window. Below, the rustle of movement—footsteps, heavy and purposeful—echoed through the building. They were coming, the guards. They had seen him. His heart hammered in his chest like a beast caught in a cage.
  </p>

  <p>
    The air was thick with tension. His mind raced with calculations, his fingers twitching for the weapon he had no longer the luxury to wield. The only thing left to him was his magic—a fleeting thing, fragile as glass—but with it, he might just stand a chance. A whisper of power surged through his veins, his fingers trembling as he began to cast.
  </p>

  <p>
    “Distract them,” he murmured, a prayer to the ancient gods whose names he no longer dared speak. The color spray would disorient them—at least long enough for him to escape. His breath hitched as the spell took shape, the iridescent lights flickering around his hands like the sparks of a dying fire. He rolled the dice—the d20 clattered across the stone floor.
  </p>

  <p>
    Not enough to take them all down, but enough to buy him a moment's respite.
  </p>

  <p>
    The light burst from his fingers, a cascade of dazzling colors that bathed the guards in its ethereal glow. Their cries of confusion echoed in the narrow passage, their movements faltering, their minds lost in the swirling chaos. Yet still, their steps were relentless, and in that moment, the fleeting victory tasted bitter in his mouth. He had only delayed the inevitable.
  </p>

  <p>
    “Run,” came the voice from the shadows. The warning was simple, but it spoke volumes. He had no choice but to heed it. His heart beat wildly as he turned, his boots silent on the stone as he dashed toward the opening he had created—a jagged hole in the roof, an escape, but one fraught with peril.
  </p>

  <p>
    His feet found the ledge, the cold stone biting into his bare skin, and he climbed. Each movement was deliberate, calculated, but the sound of footsteps growing louder behind him was a constant reminder that he was not alone. The guards were closing in, but they were still a few paces behind, confused, lost in the light.
  </p>

  <p>For a moment, he paused, hidden from their sight. The roof stretched out before him, offering a brief sanctuary. But the peace was fleeting, for the cries of the guards grew louder, more frantic, their voices filled with the fury of those who had been humiliated. He could hear them below, cursing his name, swearing vengeance.
  </p>

  <p>
    He ran.
  </p>

  <p>
    The wind howled through the ruins, a wolf’s lament as he sprinted across the roof, his cloak billowing behind him. There was no time for hesitation. The guards would find him soon, their search relentless and unforgiving. His only hope lay in the shadows beyond the roof, the shadows that belonged to the witch’s hut nestled against the far wall.
  </p>

  <p>
    He did not look back.
  </p>

  <p>
    He dropped down into the darkness of the witch’s hut, breathing deeply, silently praying that the gods would grant him more than a brief respite.
  </p>

  <p>
    The witch’s hut loomed ahead, its weathered wooden door creaking in the wind. The spellcaster's breath came in heavy gusts as he landed on the ground below, feet scraping against the stone. He quickly surveyed the area, ensuring no guards were in sight, and then darted to the door. It creaked open, revealing the dim interior, where the figure of the witch sat, her ancient eyes gleaming in the gloom.
  </p>

  <p>
    "You’ve gotten yourself into trouble, haven’t you?" she said, her voice a soft croon, tinged with a hint of amusement.
  </p>
