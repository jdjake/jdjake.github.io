  </p>

  <h4> <b> Chapter 1: A Hunt In The Woods </b> </h4>

  <p>
    The road was old and windswept. For ten days the party had wandered through the desolate, cold, mist-laden moors of swamp-country, underneath the craggy peaks of the Trolltooth mountains.
  </p>

  <p>
    Flush to Willy: "You and that damned vision. Not a bear in sight for days &mdash; just mud, mist, and misery. What I wouldn't do for a warm hearth and good company right now".
  </p>

  <p>
    Willy had spoken of a great bear, a vision he had that set them on this fool's errand into the wilderness. Willy had the hope of fashioning a warm winter cloak from the bear skin for the winters ahead. But it had been ten days, and the party's only companions had been circling ravens above, and the howl of distant wolves at night.
  </p>

  <p>
    Dawn was breaking, thin and pale. The men stirred, breaking their fast in uncomfortable silence, their breath misting in the chill. Then, on the road ahead, came a sound &mdash; muffled screams and the shuffle of countless feet. Through the mist, figures emerged, taking shape as they drew near.
  </p>

  <p>
    The group had not seen the party, who slipped into the trees flanking the road. They watched as the procession neared &mdash; a gathering of wretched souls, hollow-eyed and dirt-streaked, bearing crude weapons of wood and rusted iron. Axes meant for splitting wood, pitchforks for tilling earth. The people bore a terrible weight in their step, their faces carved from sorrow and dread.
  </p>

  <p>
    Before them stumbled a woman, her hair raven-dark, her mouth bound with rough cloth, struggling and squirming as she fought the mob with every step. A rope wound cruelly about her arms, held tight in the grip of a bearded man who averted his gaze. He did not relish this burden.
  </p>

  <p>
    Behind them rode eight warriors astride armored warhorses, their armor dulled by mist. Wolves rampant adorned their breastplates &mdash; fangs bared, claws rending. Cloaks of wolf-pelt draped over broad shoulders, their riders still and grim, watching their unwilling charge with an air of cold authority.
  </p>

  <p>
    The company watched from the trees, silent as hunters. The air was thick with portent. The woman was no mere captive, not a simple thief or wrongdoer bound for common justice. Something darker clung to this procession.
  </p>

  <p>
    Flush whispered to the others: "A witch’s doom?"
  </p>

  <p>
    Willy tightened the grip upon his blade. “Not all who burn are wicked.”
  </p>

  <p>
    Patrick responded: "Regardless. Perhaps we can steal some horses while they're distracted with whatever they're doing?"
  </p>

  <p>
    They let the host pass, shadows in the wood, unseen and silent. But their course had changed. They would follow.
  </p>

  <h4> <b> Chapter 2: The Ancient Standing Stones </b> </h4>

  <p>
    The procession trudged up a rocky slope to a craggy bluff, the wind keening through gnarled, ancient standing stones. At the centre was a squat stone altar, its surface slick with coagulated blood, four holes bored into the stone and looped with thick crude shackles of rope. Four ravens perched atop the stones, their beaks tearing through trails of gore.
  </p>

  <p>
    The eyes of the peasants were hollow with dread. The people did not wish to do this thing &mdash; but they had done it before, and they would do it again.
  </p>

  <p>
    Among the warriors strode a brute of a man, broad as an ox and weathered by the years. A scar split his face from brow to jaw, a relic of battles fought in the name of survival. His eyes, hard as flint, swept the gathering warily.
  </p>

  <p>
    Flush disguised himself as an old man, putting his hood over his face and bending over, hoping the shifting mist would aid the crude disguise. He stepped forth from the shadowed boughs of the forest’s edge, and talked to a woman among the peasants, in rasping voice.
  </p>

  <p>
    "A sorrowful day, this is. Tell me, why must the young one be chained?"
  </p>

  <p>
    "The howls, stranger. Have you not heard them? The beast that haunts the night? This wards it off"
  </p>

  <p>
    The hooded man tilted his head. "A beast, is it? And so you sate its hunger with your own kin?"
  </p>

  <p>
    "Better one than all," the woman murmured, eyes cast downward. A sacrifice a day, and the beast is sated. We draw lots &mdash; it's grim work, but fair.
  </p>

  <p>
    A scoff. "Cowards' reasoning."
  </p>

  <p>
    A hush fell over the gathered, heavy as storm-laden skies. The scarred man, the leader, turned, his eyes narrowing. "Who are you to speak of cowardice, wanderer?"
  </p>

  <p>
    Flush smiled, the gesture unseen beneath his cowl. "An old hermit of the wilds. I have no name. I see you wear the chains of fear gladly. A man does not bargain with the dark. In my day, men used to fight beasts like these".
  </p>

  <p>
    A hush. The leader’s jaw tightened. "You know nothing of the troubles we have here, old codger. Be on your way."
  </p>

  <p>
    Willy, sensing the tension in the air, emerged from the treeline. "Herpsy! There you are! Terribly sorry, sir. This is my Grandfather. He's not well in the head. He wanders off."
  </p>

  <p>
    Flush, catching on to the ploy, started barking madly, like a dog. The peasants, seeing Willy's wild eye and plate armor, shrank back, whispering amongst themselves in both fear and awe. 
  </p>

  <p>
    Flush, improvising, proclaimed "I volunteer in the young madam's place".
  </p>

  <p>
    The leader studied the stranger a moment longer before his hand left his sword hilt. "Fair enough. If you would take her place, so be it. May the gods make your death a painless one".
  </p>

  <p>
    The woman's bounds were freed, and she scrambled away, whispering frantic prayers of thanks. The old man moved to the stone, settling himself upon it as if taking a throne. The ropes were drawn tight around his limbs, but he did not flinch.
  </p>

  <p>
    Meanwhile, Willy turned to the leader. "Why haven't you slain the beast"?
  </p>

  <p>
    "The beast cannot be killed. By mortal weapons at least. By spear or by axe. The beast cannot be harmed. I used to have ten Thanes until we fought the beast. Now I am lucky to have seven."
  </p>

  <p>
    One of the warriors on horseback came forward. "If I may add, Jarl. It is a foul creature. It seems to descend out of the mist itself. We barely got away. We ran through a patch of wolfsbane, and the beast didn't seem to want to follow us through it."
  </p>

  <p>
    The leader continued: "We do not have enough of our number to risk fighting the beast again. This solution buys us time. Fortunately, a seer has come to our town. Hopefully he will be able to find a solution before it is too late".
  </p>

  <p>
    How long have you kept counsel with this seer?” Willy demanded.
  </p>

  <p>
    The Jarl responded: "He came from the woods", he muttered. "Wandered in like the wind. No home, no kin. But he has wisdom beyond reckoning". He nodded contemplatively, more for his own sake.
  </p>

  <p>
    A scoff rose from Willy and Flush.
  </p>

  <p>
    The Jarl frowned but said nothing. "Enough. We must return to Hirot and make preparations for night".
  </p>

  <p>
    The party watched the Jarl, his men, and the villagers as the mist swallowed them back up, saying nothing. Patrick emerged from his hiding place in the woods.
  </p>

  <p>
    "So they bound Flush &mdash; let's at least relieve him of his gold before he dies".
  </p>

  <p>
    "You can try", Flush warned. "I can probably still cast flaming hands. Anyway, I'm not staying here. Free me from this plinth".
  </p>

  <p>
    Willy and Patrick removed Flush's simple rope bindings, and Flush then removed his disguise. "I'll just pretend to be another member of your family now. Let's follow the townsfolk back to Hirot".
  </p>

  <h4> <b> Chapter 3: Hirot </b> </h4>

  <p>
    The wooded moors gave way to mist-laden fields, barren, crops withered from lack of light. Ahead, up the narrow track, lay the village of Hirot, defended by a low earthern rampart topped with a wooden palisade. Behind the vllage, a causeway rises to a great hall resting atop a ridge. Black hearth-smoke hangs forlornly over the village, as if even the smoke were too frightened to venture beyond the village walls.
  </p>

  <p>
    Two soldiers stood upon the ramparts. As the party approached, one raised a horn to his lips and loosed a mournful note, long and low, echoing over the empty fields. The gates creaked as they were drawn apart, revealing the streets beyond. Fires flickered in iron braziers, warding off both shadow and the unspoken dread that gripped the town like a vice. As the party entered, one guard spoke to the party:
  </p>

  <p>
    "Come in quick. The gates close at dusk. The Hound is near. They do not open again until dawn. We do not invite death inside".
  </p>

  <p>
    The other guard asked "Do you have any news from the outside world? It's been so long since we've heard anything".
  </p>

  <p>
    "The mushrooms in the forest grow well this season".
  </p>

  <p>
    The first guard scoffed, shaking his head. "Aye, tis moist enough for it. The mist &mdash; it never clears. It clings to the bones of this place."
  </p>

  <p>
    The party entered in silence, their presence acknowledged only by wary nods and the rustling of cloaks against the wind. The city was hushed, its people shuttered behind heavy doors, whispering prayers to gods who seldom answered. Willy turned to Patrick and muttered "They cower within walls of timber and thatch, yet the beast hunts in mist and shadow. No gate will hold it back".
  </p>

  <p>
    The party travelled through the streets of Hirot to the townsquare. At the heart of the village loomed an inn, its heavy wooden doors reinforced with thick iron bars. Above the door, carved into old wood, a sign bore the emblem of a spear tipped with the huge fang. The Wolfspear Inn.
  </p>

  <p>
    Broegan, the keeper, met them at the threshold, his eyes sharp with the weight of responsibility.
  </p>

  <p>
    "You're the ones who saved my girl".
  </p>

  <p>
    Flush nodded.
  </p>

  <p>
    Broegan clapped him hard on the shoulder. "Then you eat, drink, and sleep here for free. I thought my daughter was lost".
  </p>

  <p>
    The party was brought into a common room, where some peasants had already started laying out straw to sleep on the floor below. As they sat at the long, splintered table, Willy turned to the girl who had almost been sacrificed, Morgan, who nursed the bruises where the bindings had been tightened. "My grandfather gave his life for yours. Why did your father not take your place?"
  </p>

  <p>
    "My father fought for me. But when the time came..." She swallowed, throat tight. "He could not muster his courage. We are all so afraid. The creature does not merely kill. It flays. It takes its time to kill. We have to gag those we sacrifice, or we'd never get any sleep for the screams".
  </p>

  <p>
    Outside, in the dusk, a howl rose. It was not the cry of any ordinary wolf.
  </p>

  <p>
    "Is your mother here?", Willy asked.
  </p>

  <p>
    She hesitated. “Long, long gone".
  </p>

  <p>
    "And a husband?"
  </p>

  <p>
    After a pause, she shook her head. "No. No husband". A pause. Her fingers curled slightly against the rim of her cup.
  </p>

  <p>
    Flush turned to the rest of the peasants. "Why do you sleep here".
  </p>

  <p>
    "The beast comes in the dead of night. The first few nights, it dragged our kin straight from their beds. Now, we know better. We hide. Board our doors. Safety in numbers."
  </p>

  <p>
    "How does it enter?"
  </p>

  <p>
    "It simply appear out of nowhere. Shadow given form. It tears and rends, then vanishes."
  </p>

  <p>
    The wizard grunted. "And it leaves the bodies?"
  </p>

  <p>
    The gaunt man nodded, his face ashen. "Aye. Scattered in pieces. Seems to eat nothing. A feast prepared, but unfinished."
  </p>

  <p>
    A peasant at the back of the room, swaddled in filthy wool, clutched a small flask. “I keep lamb’s blood in here”, he muttered. "If the beast attacks me, I'll fling it to the ground, and hope the beast will take it instead."
  </p>

  <p>
    Another man, reeking of stale ale, perked up. “I cover myself in hay while I sleep! Hope that'll fool the beast".
  </p>

  <p>
    Willy tapped a scarred finger against the bar. "And the Jarl? What does he say?"
  </p>

  <p>
    A murmur passed through the gathered peasants. The gaunt man licked his lips. "The Jarl listens to the seer. Always whispering at his side. It is he who runs the lottery."
  </p>

  <p>
    The warrior’s expression did not change. "Lottery?"
  </p>

  <p> "For the sacrifice. Each morning, a name is drawn. A life given to the dark."
  </p>

  <p>
    And this seer &mdash; when did he arrive?"
  </p>

  <p>
    "Two months past".
  </p>

  <p>
    "And the beast?"
  </p>

  <p>
    "One month past".
  </p>

  <p>
    The warrior exhaled through his nose. "Convenient."
  </p>

  <p>
    The tavern door burst open. A man, clad in colored fabric, staggered in, a small stringed instrument strappd to his back. "Morgan!" he cried, his voice breaking. "You live!" He rushed to the woman’s side, embracing her, fingers clinging as if to a dream.
  </p>

  <p>
    The warrior watched with quiet amusement. "No husband yet, I suppose."
  </p>

  <p>
    Willy leaned back, surveying the room. Above the fire, a great spear gleamed, tipped with a huge fang like that on the sign of the inn &mdash; or though it seemed. Sadly, it was wooden, painted blue-silver rather than the real deal. A symbol of strength that would shatter in a real battle.
  </p>

  <p>
    Broegan commented on Willy's interest: "You like the spear, eh? An imitation of the Wolf-Spear of old, a relic of the savage kings who once ruled these lands, a weapon said to pin even the most fearsome of beasts to the frozen earth". His lips curled into a grimace that might have been a smile, though there was no mirth behind it. "We can surely use a weapon like that now".
  </p>

  <h4> <b> Chapter 4: The Mad Widow Ymae </b> </h4>

  <p>
    Hoping to explore before night truly began, Patrick asked the peasants what there was to do in town.
  </p>

  <p>
    "The hound is loose tonight," murmured a bearded man, his voice low with superstition. "None with sense walk the streets past dusk."
  </p>

  <p>
    Another, a wiry man with a scar across his brow, nodded. "Aye, safer within these walls. The Jarl's house stands atop the hill, but even they bar their doors before dark."
  </p>

  <p>
    At a nearby table, a band of travelers listened. One, clad in a cloak dark as a raven's wing, leaned forward. "The Jarl's hall &mdash; what lies within?"
  </p>

  <p>
    "More than we’ll ever see," the bearded man grunted. "Peasants like us, we're not welcome there."
  </p>

  <p>
    The man who had embraced Morgan began to tune at his instrument in the corner, plucking at the strings with calloused fingers. His song was yet to begin, but the tension in the room made the silence heavy. The firelight flickered against the rough-hewn beams, casting uneasy shadows.
  </p>

  <p>
    A woman, her voice hushed, spoke from across the room. "While you are in town, there is one place you must not go. Ymae's hovel. A witch dwells there."
  </p>

  <p>
    At that, several men muttered prayers, eyes flicking toward the rafters as though afraid to summon her name.
  </p>

  <p>
    Patrick smirked. "Just an old hag?"
  </p>

  <p>
    "Mock her if you will," the woman said, her face pale, "but those who cross her path bear misfortune. It is said she takes her power from the bones of those who defied her."
  </p>

  <p>
    Willy rose. "Sounds like something to see for ourselves".
  </p>

  <p>
    So the two stepped out into the bitter dark. The village cowered in fear, doors were barred, and windows shut against what lurked in the blackness.
  </p>

  <h4> <b> Chapter 4: The Mad Widow Ymae </b> </h4>

  <p>
    The houses of Hirot thinned out at the outskirts of town, around Ymae's hovel, as if repelled by the house, pressed against the trees. Twisted branches clawed the sky above it, and the thatch of its roof was blackened with age. Patrick knocked three times on the front door.
  </p>

  <p>
    A voice rasped from within. "Come in! Come in!"
  </p>

  <p>
    Patrick hesitated, before pushing the doom open and stepping into the strange interior. Despite it's humble outer appearance, the cottage seemed impossibly large. A fire roared in the center of the room, crackling and spitting flames that cast wild shadows upon the shelvers, where odd relics and jars of strange substances lined the walls. A black cat, mangy and thin, watched with knowing eyes from the top of the shelf.
  </p>

  <p>
    The old woman herself was hunched over, her gnarled hands working a spindle. The threads, golden and flaming, entered the spindle from the fire below. Her eyes gleamed with an unsettling knowing as she glanced up at the travelers.
  </p>

  <p>
    "You don’t look like the simpletons around here," she remarked with a thin smile, her voice rasping like dry leaves. "Come, sit by the fire. It’ll be dark soon. The beast will be here soon."
  </p>

  <p>
    Patrick and Willy glanced at each other uncertainly, but didn't know how to argue against the woman. They sat, as the fire flickered and danced in the hearth.
  </p>

  <p>
    Ymae giggled: "You fear me. I've always been here, the townsfolk have known me all their lives, and have all grown up to fear me. The children, they dare each other to get within eyesight of my window, but they're no bother beyond that. And I like to stick to myself, so it's not bother. But you're from out of time. You're not simpletons. You have no reason to fear me. I'm not the cause of the hound".
  </p>

  <p>
    Old May’s voice shrank low, almost a whisper. "The hound, you see, it’s not like other creatures. It’s a thing of nightmares. Born from the darkest shadows, a curse unleashed upon this cursed land. It comes at night, howling for blood, its eyes like burning embers. But don't worry &mdash;" She gestured to the room around them, "&mdash; we are safe here. I've enchanted the walls. I have the hairs. They protect us. The beast cannot enter."
  </p>

  <p>
    The wind howled again, and from outside, came the sound of something prowling—heavy, deliberate steps that rattled the earth itself. The beast had come.
  </p>

  <p>
    Willy spoke, "What hair?"
  </p>

  <p>
    "The hair of the dead of course. When I caught wind of the beast, I weaved it into my thatched roof".
  </p>

  <p>
    "Where did you get the hair".
  </p>

  <p>
    The old woman smiled a toothless grin. Ohhh &mdash; this mad witch has her ways.
  </p>

  <p>
    "Can you make something to protect me from the beast".
  </p>

  <p>
    "That and more. But you'd have to make a promise", she croaked.
  </p>

  <p>
    Outside, the sounds of death began &mdash; screams and the unholy tearing of flesh echoed through the village.
  </p>

  <p>
    "You want a promise?" Willy asked, his voice low, thick with suspicion. "What kind of promise do you ask?"
  </p>

  <p>
    She did not answer immediately, her wrinkled hands paused at the spindle. The crackle of fire was the only sound between them for a moment, as though the room itself held its breath. Finally, the woman spoke, her voice soft yet laden with expectation, "I am getting too old to tend to this hearth. I need a husband. You would have to promise to marry me".
  </p>

  <p>
    "I cannot bring you a husband", Willy said flatly, "not while death stalks these lands."
  </p>

  <p>
    The woman’s eyes flickered with something ancient, something dark. "Then I suppose you will not have the magic you seek".
  </p>

  <p>
    A moment of silence passed. The warrior’s eyes narrowed. What was it about her? Was she truly as harmless as she appeared, or was there some deeper darkness hiding beneath her brittle shell? Her words lingered, pulling at him like a thread unraveling in the winds of an old curse. And yet, despite the wariness clawing at his gut, he felt the odd weight of her request settle on his shoulders.
  </p>

  <p>
    "Stay the night darlings. Keep warm around the fire", Ymae croaked, and returned to spinning her yarn.
  </p>

  <h4> <b> Chapter 5: The Next Morning </b> </h4>

  <p>
    The cold light of a misty dawn broke over the desolate village, casting long shadows across the bloodied streets. A bitter wind stirred the remnants of a night’s horrors—bodies, shredded and scattered, now merely a grisly smear across the town square. The air carried the metallic scent of blood, thick and unyielding, clinging to the old stones like a curse. The bell rang again, its toll echoing across the empty homes, a summons that pulled reluctant souls from their meager sleep.
  </p>

  <p>
    Within the walls of the inn, Flush awoke to the ringing of a bell. He rushed outward. The blood ran in rivers through the streets, seeping into the dirt. Gutted entrails, remnants of flesh, and dismembered limbs lay scattered like refuse from some foul ritual. No one had been sacrificed at the standing stones. And this was the result.
  </p>

  <p>
    Flush, grim in his resolve, stepped forward. With an empty, weathered bag in hand, he began collecting body parts from the streets. If he arranged the parts around the standing stone, he might be able to trick the village into thinking there was still a sacrifice. He jumped the wall of the keep, and headed to the stones.
  </p>

  <p>
    Meanwhile, Willy and Patrick awoke in the witches house, and followed the bell ringing to the town square. The morning air was biting.
  </p>

  <p>
    The Jarl was already in the town square. He stood tall, draped in furs. Beside him stood a wretch of a man, ringing the bell in his hand. Willy decided to observe what was happening, while Patrick decided to attempt to sneak into the Jarl's hall while everyone was preoccupied.
  </p>

  <p>
    "Jarl", Willy called out, his voice cutting through the hum of the crowd. The Jarl turned, his eyes narrowing as he regarded the strangers with suspicion.
  </p>

  <p>
    "I thought you went on your way" the Jarl replied. "It looks as if your grandfather's death was in vain. And now we've lost our leather worker, our smith, our baker, among others. Perhaps only members of our own village can be sacrificed to sate the beast. We begin our next lottery now".
  </p>

  <p>
    The adventurers exchanged a glance. “How does this lottery work?” Willy asked.
  </p>

  <p>
    The wretch by the Jarl tolled the bell once more. Sylle Ru, the seer of the village. As the adventurers looked around, they saw the faces of the villagers &mdash; hollow-eyed, resigned to their fate. The time for sacrifice was fast approaching.
  </p>

  <p>
    Two scrawny figures, their flesh marked by vicious scars, stepped forward with whips in hand. Their eyes gleamed with an unnatural fervor, their hands trembling in anticipation. The whip cracked, its sound like the roar of an unseen beast, as a priest, a man draped in tattered robes, shouted from behind. "Repent! The end times are upon us. The Hound, the great beast, demands blood! It is sin that calls the Hound, and sin that binds us all to this fate. Repent!"
  </p>

  <p>
    The bell-wringing wretch blindfolded the Jarl, now standing in the center of the town square. Around him, the peasantry gathered, their hearts heavy with dread, their eyes flicking nervously to the shadows.
  </p>

  <p>
    The blindfolded Jarl felt the worn surface of the key that had been pulled from the lockbox. His hands trembled as they grasped the piece of parchment inside. Behind the Jarl, the priest continued his chanting.

  <h4> <b> Chapter 6: Robbing The Hall </b> </h4>

  <p>
    Meanwhile, Patrick took to side streets, heading toward the great hall looming above the town, a structure as ancient and decayed as the town itself. The golden straw roof, now faded and sagging, seemed to mock the very nature of the land. He could see a few guards at the front door, but most had headed to the lottery.
  </p>

  <p>
    Before the guards could see him, Patrick slipped into the shadows around the side of the Great Hall. He took off his shoes, his calloused feet bare against the cold mud, and silently summoned an incantation, Sixela's Spider Climb. His fingers curled as short, spindly hairs began to sprout from his hands and feet, and he began to ascend the timber walls of the hall.
  </p>

  <p>
    Patrick's heart pounded in his chest as he reached the top of the great hall. Below, he heard the sound of the crowd gathering for the lottery, the chanting and wailing of the priest. Below, guards, grim and silent, hauled the dead of the village up the hill, where a cremation pyre was being constructed. Focusing, he pushed his fingers through the hay that lined the roof of the hall, and entered.
  </p>

  <p>
    Inside the mead hall, the air reeked of stale ale, sweat, and the sour scent of too many men packed into too small a space. There were benches, worn and crooked, around tables cluttered with empty drinking horns. Set against the far wall was the Jarl's throne, an ornate chair, carved from dark wood. A few scattered guards stood watch, but their attention was lax.
  </p>

  <p>
    Patrick dropped into the hall, silent as death itself, and moved toward the benches, eyes scanning for anything of value, before entering a room at the far end of the mead hall, into the Jarl's bed chamber. There was little of value, though in a drawer Patrick found two dozen gold rings, among various coins. He returned to the mead hall, and in a fit of rebelliousness, pissed in a drinking cup arranged next to the Jarl's home.
  </p>

  <p>
    As the sound echoed thinly &mdash; there was a muffled clink of metal. The guards had noticed the faint tremor in the air. Patrick’s breath caught in his throat. He could not afford to be seen.
  </p>

  <p>
    Without a moment's hesitation, Patrick turned and bolted toward the wall. The chase had begun. Before he climbed, he summoned a bought of color spray, the iridescent lights flickering around his hands like the sparks of a dying fire. The light burst from his fingers, bathing the guards in swirling caos. Not enough to take all of the guards down, but enough to buy him a moment's respite.
  </p>

  <p>
    Patrick swiftly climbed back up the wall, and towards the jagged hole he had torn in the roof. For a moment, he paused, hidden from their sight. The roof stretched out before him, offering a brief sanctuary. But the peace was fleeting, for the cries of the guards grew louder, more frantic, their voices filled with the fury of those who had been humiliated. He could hear them below, cursing. He swiftly crawled down the outer wall of the great hall, and ran, his cloak billowing behind him.
  </p>

  <p>
    He did not look back.
  </p>

  <p>
    His only hope lay in the cliff below the great hall, in the shadows that belonged to the witch’s hut nestled against the cliff. The guards would not pursue him there. He descended the cliff, into the darkness of the witch’s hut, breathing deeply, silently praying that the gods would grant him more than a brief respite.
  </p>

  <p>
    The witch’s hut creaked in the wind. The spellcaster's breath came in heavy gusts as he landed on the ground below, feet scraping against the stone. He quickly surveyed the area, ensuring no guards were in sight, and then darted to the door. It creaked open, revealing the dim interior, where the figure of the witch sat, still spindling, her ancient eyes gleaming in the gloom.
  </p>

  <p>
    "You’ve gotten yourself into trouble, haven’t you?" she said, her voice a soft croon, tinged with a hint of amusement.
