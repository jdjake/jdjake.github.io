  </p>

  <h4> <b> Part 1: Shipwrecked In The Dark </b> </h4>

  <p>
    The dragon boat surged forward, crashing onto the jagged rock. The underground river rushed on through the darkness, carrying the boat with an irresistible current. The boat's eldritch glow reflected off the damp walls, glittering off the water spray. Ahead, the river parted against a sharp rock, into which the boat slammed, cleaving in two; Willy and Heidi found themselves on one side of the boat, the rest of the party disappearing behind them on the other side of the river. As their half-vessel spun wildly, slamming against the side of the river, a crashing of water upon stone became louder, the sound of aa subterranean waterfall. Their boat segment miraculously stayed afloat, sweeping around a bend of the tunnel, dashing on a jut of hard rock, temporarily halting the boat's passage. To the left, a pebbly beach of rounded stones was just visible in the fading glow of the boat.
  </p>

  <p>
    Heidi and Willy took their chances, diving out of the boat as the shattered remains of their ship tipped over the falls, darkness falling as their only light source fell from view. They scrambled frantically onto the smooth, hard stones of the shore. Before they could even catch their breach, they realized they were not alone. Chitin clattered on stone around them, and small, hard bodies brushed past their ragged soggy clothing, shortly followed by the sting of sharp pincers piercing flesh. Their troubles were not over yet.
  </p>

  <p>
    The pair flailed in the darkness, trying to get free. Though they sustained some cuts, their frantic movements managed to smash some bodies against the shore, releasing a pungent odor, and an almost-human squeal. A horde of clicks and snips echoed around them, spurring the pair to flee from the shore. But where to go in the pitch black? Grasping desperately along the rocks, by some stroke of luck it did not take too long for the pair to find rough handholds carved in the face of a cliff on the north side of the beach, which could carry them to higher ground away from the slow moving horrors. Heidi clambered up, as another call came from behind -- Flush the Gambler was here, who'd recently raided the Portal Under The Stars with his childhood friends. But how?
  </p>

  <p>
    It had been a fortnight since those childhood friends had raided the portal and carried away it's treasures. Flush, ever the risk taker, had taken his fortune to the nearest county town, and attempted to wager his prize for a larger horde of riches. The plan didn't go so well, and Flush's pockets were again near emptied. As Flush slept away his sorrow, he had a prophetic dream, of a tower amidst a ruined city far beneath the earth, and of eyes peering through the darkness. The tower possessed knowledge of great magick, and the eyes could provide the fuel for that magic. Flush's visions continued, night after night, until he was lead to a yawning cave far to the east of the city. As Flush attempted a descent into that cave with his trusty pig Genevieve, a tremor sent him plummeting over a precarious ledge down into the darkness, into a freezing subterranean pool. That tremor was the result of the dragon boat being cleaved in two, and the freezing pool the same Willy and Heidi had passed into on their perilous ride. And that was how Flush ended up fending for his life alongside Willy and Heidi.
  </p>

  <p>
    Willy tossed Flush's pig up over the ledge towards Heidi. Flush ascended upon the handholds, while Willy dodged snapping creatures from below, before climbing to join them. The group appeared to be in relative safety, allowing a short rest, and for Heidi's suspicious to grow of their new friend. Heidi suspected dark wizardry with Flush, and confronted him. Perhaps Heidi's anger triggered a surge of arcane fire to course through Flush's veins, and he attempted to channel this fire through his hands, perhaps to illuminate the dark passage around them, or perhaps to intimidate Heidi. The spell misfired, and instead flames instead erupted from Flush's backpack, burning it to a cinder husk. Heidi's anger cooled.  realizing that, if Flush *was* a dark wizard, he was a bad one at that.
  </p>

  <p>
    Willy had had enough of the absurd argument, and decided to investigate the dark outcrop they rested upon. His hands stumbled upon three long spears lying next to a passage in the rock, each with backward-pointed barbed hooks sculpted from bone. Willy alerted the others to his discovery. Flush sent his trusty pig companion into the dark tunnel to check for traps. The pig's panicked squeals heralded the arrival of a gang of a menagerie of grotesque humanoid figures: their leader was incredibly thin, with skin stretched over a skeletal frame, and the monstrous head of a tusked boar, carrying a bone flute on a cord around their neck. Though seemingly savage and strange, the group put down their weapons in a gesture of peace. The group responded, and the leader introduced itself through a series of grunts, complemented by whistles from a bone pipe wrapped around it's neck. The closest name the group could come up with for these noises was something like "Ma-Gok", who now gestured for the group to follow him through the tunnels they came from.
  </p>

  <h4> <b> Part 2: The Chanting City </b> </h4>

  <p>
    The party trailed behind their new friends through a long snaking tunnel, which eventually opened up onto an awesome sight, an enormous cavern, whose ceiling, at least a hundred feet high, glowed as if adorned with blue stars. An ancient stone city sprawled below, narrow lanes twisting among stone buildings, winding towards a huge central colosseum-like structure, though no light came from within. Shuffling forms moved through dim streets, with little light of any type, as through the air came the sound of dripping of stone upon stone, flutes piping back and forth in conversation, and distantly, something like the hollow chanting of monks coming from below the very rock.
  </p>

  <p>
    One member of the group, thick-legged creature with the small, baby-like head called something like "Agog", turned to address the party. "You--Live--Here--Now", it proclaimed awkwardly as it attempted to welcome the group to it's city. The creature seemed much more comfortable communicating with flute than with voice.
  </p>

  <p>
    Flush recognized the city from his visions, in particular, the tall tower that stretched upward from around the smaller buildings of the city. He asked if he could enter the tower. The boar-headed leader warned him that his people avoided the tower, possessing a sinister aura, but that they could stay in any house they wanted. The group didn't have a strong sense of property, and seemed to live in whatever buildings favored them at the time. After discussion, Flush headed to the tower, and Willy went off in search of food, while Heidi stayed behind with the group.
  </p>

  <p>
    Ma-Gok pointed Heidi towards a wall on the western side of the cavern, where figures could be seen in the shadows on the cliff face, and asked whether he could climb. Heidi nodded in agreement, and Ma-Gok showed him to the wall. Using his flute, Ma-Gok talked to a figure with kangaroo-like legs and an octopian head, who handed Heidi a set of ancient, jagged metal tools, and a strap holstered with jars. A smaller figure, with a saurian head and spider-like arms, who introduced themselves to Heidi with a name like 'Pukk-Durd', directed Heidi to the wall. 
  </p>

  <p>
    The pair ascended a series of spongy, wood-like ladders along the edge of the cavern. As Heidi neared the top of the cavern, the blue glow came into focus, in actuality clusters of glowworms hanging from the ceiling on threads of mucus. Following Pukk-Durd's instructions, Heidi carefully threaded the metal tools through a narrow cloaca in the bottom of the glowworm. A delicate tickling motion coaxed a milk-like goo to secret from the cloaca, into a jar Heidi held underneath. The goo was cherished by the society below, a small but vital source of nutrition.
  </p>

  <p>
    Meanwhile, Willy roamed the meandering streets of the city, cluttered with cell-like buildings in varying states of decay. The structures seemed unimaginably old, perhaps still ancient when humanity was still in its infancy. The original builders had left no clues of who they were, though the buildings hinted they must have been close to humankind in size and build. Now the people of the city lived in these buildings, choosing homes at random day to day wherever their mood strook them at the time. Most were completely unoccupied, the society far smaller than the original population of this city must have been.
  </p>

  <p>
    Drawn by the sound of jubilant piping, Willy stumbled upon a small fire encircled by a small group. He made gestures asking where he might find food, and a musky, crocodilian-headed figure lead Willy northeast, through a tunnel and into a small cavern, about the size of a house. The cavern was filled with a large fungal growth of grayish-mauve mold, through which felt golden-tipped rhizomes. Dozens lay sprawled atop the mound, some sleeping, others consuming the mold, oblivious to Willy's presence.
  </p>

  <p>
    Willy sampled the mold, which had a dank, dirty taste, but was surprisingly filling, and slightly moorish. Willy feared if he consumed more he wouldn't be able to pull himself away from the pile. Uneasy, Wily left the cavern, vowing not to indulge further.
  </p>

  <p>
    Flush made his way toward the tower on the southeastern edge of the city. It's architecture stood apart from the surrounding ruins: pentagonal, crafted from clean, greenish-grey stone that seemed to resist the passage of time. There was no door protecting the dark interior of the tower, but only a small stone arch ringed with strange sigils. Flush reached out with his arcane senses to try and understand these sigils, but was unsuccessful. Undeterred, he stepped through the archway.
  </p>

  <p>
    As he crossed the threshold, a fog clouded his mind. The reason for entering the tower slipped away like a forgotten dream. Confused, Flush turned back and wandered back into town to regroup with the others who might remember why he ventured off in the first place.
  </p>

  <p>
    Later that day, the group reunited and pieced together what had happened. Flush realized he was missing part of his memory - he couldn't recall visiting the tower, and went back with the other two to investigate. At the tower, Flush again tried to use arcane power to decipher the sigils around the tower. His efforts triggered a peculiar effect: Willy and Heidi were temporarily struck mute. Unaware of the enchantment's nature, the group achieved a comedy of memories as they each tried to enter the tower, only to return moments later in confusion, including Flush's sow.
  </p>

  <p>
    Eventually they devised a plan. The group pushed Flush through the doorway from a safe distance, with Flush holding a note in front of his face that explained his purpose entering the tower. This allowed Flush to bypass the memory-wiping magic, through sheer will, which dispelled the memory magic that protected the inside of the tower.
  </p>

  <p>
    Inside the tower, the interior walls formed a maze of surfaces carved with intricate runes. Even in the darkness, the runes were clearly visible, effortlessly drawing the eye before them, though shifting and rearranging when not directly observed. Above, the walls stretched impossibly upward, far beyond what the outside appearance should allow, and above stars -- or something like them -- twinkled far off in the vast upper distance.
  </p>

  <p>
    There are 575 wizard spells in this realm. No more. No less. This number is known because Hakim the Haikon, a great mage of the Third Aeon, briefly awakened a somnolent elder god, which susurrated several secrets (in haiku, of course) before returning to it's eternal slumber. It is the measure of success for every wizard to fill their spell book with as many of these 575 spells as can be found in their lifetime. Flush got the feeling that the runes of this tower might contain knowledge of all the spells, if only they could spend several lifetimes deciphering the runes' secrets.
  </p>

  <p>
    Over the next week, the party quickly adapted to their surroundings, and we briefly describe how the party members occupied their time:
  </p>

  <p>
    For seven days and seven nights, Flush fasted alone within the tower, meditating on the secrets of the runes, as the glowing inscriptions began to whisper ancient truths of the fire magic he'd haphazardly used before.
  </p>

  <p>
    In the meantime, Heidi found purpose among the glowworm harvesters. With glowing skill, he mastered the delicate art of milking the worms for their precious sustenance. As he worked, he began to find his place within the community -- a place he might need to make a permanent home if a way out of the realm was impossible.
  </p>

  <p>
    Willy succumbed to the addictive powers of the hallucinogenic mold. He succumbed to its addictive effects, with nights lost in vivid, surreal dreams, of a flourishing city deep underground, illuminated with jewels, and populated with reptilian humans, as a deep pool of darkness gathered below. One night, while Willy was partially lost in a psychotropic daze, a monstrous figure emerged from the darkness, an elephant sized creature, shaped like a giant egg, striding forth on dozens of pairs of suckered legs, with long, flexible probusci emerging from the egg, at least three inches in diameter. It scuttled towards those reclined on the fungus, its appendages reaching hungrily for their faces.
  </p>

  <p>
    Willy, dazed but not entirely helpless, narrowly dodged the probing probusci as it reached for him. Willy thought to warn his friends of that horror, but just one more taste of that exquisite, wonderful fungus wouldn't hurt...
