    <h1> Bargains and Betrayals </h1>

  <h4> <b> Date: </b> March 27th, 2024 </h4>
  <h4> <b> Players: </b> Abe, Dan, Hugh </h4>

  <br>

  <div>

  <h4> <b> Characters </b> </h4>
  <p>
    Abe played <em>Bep 'Gunpowder' Glover</em>, a Jesuit Monk based on the isle of Yuma. Known for his stench, the rotten teeth hanging out of his mouth, and his preference for alchohol.
  </p>
  <p>
    Dan played <em>Iago ‘Le Red Bird’</em>, a backstabbing rapscallion, a sailor with an insatiable urge for treasure. His previous adventures lead him to a narrow escape from a cannibalistic ending, but he never escaped <em>that smell</em>.
  </p>
  <p>
    Hugh played <em> Low Roller </em>, a swashbuckler who concealed a mysterious past as a barkeep with a liking for mocking banter amongst the other crewmates. There was <em>something contagious</em> about him.
  </p>
  <p>
    Dan also played <em>Eva 'Two Toes' Martinez</em>, a Rotund wig-wearing Buccaneer. Marooned after a failed mutinee aboard the Portugeuse navy, Eva picked himself up and had been running some odd jobs to make a name for himself in the free ports of the Carribean.
  </p>
  <p>
    Dan also played <em>Annemicke 'Flatline' Hollegate</em>, a known pirate and heretic amongst the colonial powers of the Caribbean. He'd gained a knack for wilderness survival, even if it'd cost him his right eye in the process.
  </p>

  <h4> <b> Reencountering the Orb </b> </h4>

  <p>
    After the adrenaline of the fight had subsided, Dan headed over to Abe, who, by some miracle, still clung to his life, his breath struggled and faint, occasionally muttering something incomprehensible. Dan tended to Abe's visable wounds, and then gave Abe a sharp slap to the face to try and bring him back to consciousness. While Abe got his bearings back, Hugh kept his dagger tight to the throat of the sole survivor of the fight, the leader of the cultists. He demanded her to tell them her name. She spat her name back venomously. Her name was Marosha.
  </p>

  <p>
    Once ready, the group descended back into the cavern to reinvestigate. The dinghy still remained down in the back of the cavern, abandoned by the cultists who had ran to confront the party. The glowing sphere still sat on the floor of the boat, pulsating with light, the bottom of the dinghy close to the orb appearing tough and weathered.
  </p>

  <p>
    Hugh, driven by a sudden curiosity, reached out to touch the sphere. The moment his fingertips touched the sphere, his mind melted away, and he found himself in a void. Thousands of ethereal luminescent spheres surrounded him. He couldn't help but feel that the orbs were *staring... angrily*. Hugh felt some dark tendrils of some dark ethereal force begin to creep closer to wards him, and in a panic, Hugh let go of the orb, returning to the cavern. From the perspective of everyone else, in the instant Hugh had touched the orb, Hugh's hair and fingernails had grown at an unnatural rate. By the time he was back to reality, his hairhad grown to his chest, noticible greyer, and his fingernails curled around his fingers. His skin was more wrinkled than before, looking at least 5 or 6 years older than when he'd touched the orb.
  </p>

  <p> Marosha cackled:
  </p>

  <p  style="margin-left: 25px;">
    <em> Now you realize what you hold in your hand. There's no way to stop it. The sunken one is awakening. Soon it will escape from beneath the Black Crag! </em>
  </p>

  <p>
    Unneverved by the orb, but curious to see the orbs power in more detail, the players allowed Marosha to touch the orb. She jumped into the boat, grasping the orb in a fetal position. She began to shake with delight, her body visibly aging. The players debated trying to pull her away, but held back. Marosha continuing withering passing 80, 90, 100 years of age, past the point of life, but this didn't stop the degradation. Soon her skin began peeling off the bone, her clothing rotting away, until only a skeleton hugging the orb remained.
  </p>

  <p>
    The gang, clearly not wanting to stay too close to the orb, decided to use the ropes around the dinghy to pull the sphere up to the top of the hill, and then find a place to bury the orb in the morning to be recovered by the company that had recruited them to retrieve the meteorite. They spent about an hour pulling the dinghy out of the cave. They could feel the orb pulsate, perhaps feeling some melovolent forces intrude upon their thought, perhaps searching for something. But no serious long term harm came over their hours of work. Exhausted, they decided to sleep on the beach for the rest of the night, planning to bury the orb in the morning.
  </p>

  <h4> <b> Clementius and the Ambush </b> </h4>

  <p>
    In the faint light of the early morning, mixed with the pulsating green of the orb, the group was awakened by a loud whistle. A monstrous creature leapt from the foliage of the jungle, jaguar sized, with jagged teeth, the horns of an elk, cracked, rocky skin, and a single, coconut sized eye. It growled at them, and then began chasing it's tail. A tall, well dressed man followed, shouting *Heel!* in an aristrocratic accent. The creature paused at the command, and temporarily sat at it's master's feet.
  </p>

  <p>
    Staring at them with a piercing gaze, the man proclaimed:
  </p>

  <p  style="margin-left: 25px;">
    <em> 
      No further harm needs to mar this day. My fellow kin are arrogant, especially my niece. We seek only the sphere. Perhaps we can negotiate...
    </em>
  </p>

  <p>
    The man made another gesture at the jungle, and three cultists emerged from the clearing, dragging a familiar face behind them. Gary was in somewhat of a trance, dragged by his legs along the floor. Somewhat forced into an unwanted pact, the party begrudgingly acquiesed to the deal, shaking hands with the man, who introduced himself as Clementius.
  </p>

  <p>
    Feeling cheated, the group decided to head into the jungle and watch the group from the shadows. Under Clementius' watchful eye, the three cultists started dragging the dinghy across the shore towards their ship, a small, single-masted sloop with black sails. Clementius ocassionally took leave to banish several undead who were wandering the shores before them. The three cultists pulled the dinghy until about midday, and by the time they neared the ship, the orbs certainly seemed to have taken their toll on them.
  </p>

  <p>
    Seizen a moment of opportunity, the party infiltrated the cultist's ship, dispatching the two cultists who sat below deck. The party hid the cultist's dead bodies in empty barrels in the hold, and then got in their own barrels to hide in wait. As they sat in that tense state, their eyes started to adjust to the darkness of the hold, and they noticed that from the ceiling of the hold, hundreds of human eyes hung from their sinews on the rafters.
  </p>

  <p>
    As the cultists on the beach grew closer, Clementius yelled at the dead cultists on board to let down a ramp to allow them to pull the dinghy onto the boat. After a long silence, the three cultists climbed aboard the ship from the rigging, and let down the ramp themselves.
   </p>

  <p>
    Clementius descended into the hold, readying himself to scold what he presumed were his acolytes, perhaps sleeping or slacking off. It was then when the gang took the opportunity, bursting out of their barrels to make ambush. After taking a shot to his shoulder, Clementius cursed the pirates, his aristocratic decorum shaken, and chanted some incantations. The dead cultists began to jerkily come to life in the barrels next to the party. They took bites out of Gary and Parash, while the group tried to finish Clementius off.
  </p>

  <p>
    The other cultists ran down to defend their boss. They collective conjured force a dark smoke into the room. Most of the party was able to expel the smoke before any ill effect occured. Abe ran over to check other barrels around the room, finding gunpowder, and smearing it over the wooden cross he'd found from his chapel. He slammed it into the ground, generating sparks which ignited the cross. He made a charge at the cultists, but narrowly missed them, crashing into the staircase. Gasping for breath, Abe was not able to react to the cultist's second wave of the spell, and he breathed deeply the dark fumes, which ignited in his lungs, and he collapsed, seriously injured again. One of the cultists was killed, before the other two put their arms in the air, begging for Parley.
