  <h4> <b> Summary </b> </h4>

  <p>
    Flush and Heidi's daily routine was stirred the following week when Ma-Gok brought the pair back to the beach where their journey into the city had begun. Their, amid the other crab hunters tending to wounds, the pair were reunited with eight peasants who'd survived the sacrificial rite at the monolith upon the Starless Sea one week earlier. The peasants, bedraggled and hollow-eyed, spoke of a week clinging for dear life ahold slimy rocks within labyrinthian tunnels, haunted by the sound and smell of terrors moving in the dark. Flush and Heidi offered the group what comfort they could, leading their weary allies back to the shadowed streets of the city. As they returned, the distant chanting -- so constant it had faded into the backdrop of their lives over the past week -- reasserted it's presence.  Compelled by a gnawing curiosity, and since none of the townsfolk would speak about the amphitheater, the party resolved to investigate the source of the chanting.
  </p>

  <p>
    The amphitheater loomed over the party as they entered one of it's long vomitoria. The party's flickering torches illuminated seven rows of stone seats encircling a three hundred foot round clearing, surrounding a gaping central pit. From the pit came that chanting, guttural, inhuman, and unimaginable complex. To probe it's mysteries, the party secured Wolfgang the Dwarven Miner to a rope, and lowered him into the unfathomable dark.
  </p>

  <p>
    The shaft, unnaturally smooth, hinted at tools that defied craftsmanship known from the tools of this age. The chanting from below slowly seemed to become louder and louder. Panicked, Wolfgang called the party to pull him back up, as three abominations rose from the pit -- fungal creatures, like insect-winged mushrooms crossed with evil-looking lobsters, writhing from below. As the creatures inhaled and exhaled, spiracles on their carapace discharged a continual chanting in some ancient language; perhaps all mortal languages are tainted by it, for as the creatures reached Wolfgang, he came to the realization that the murmuring was an endless paean to a vast primordia corruption, an alien evil that lay in the hole far below them. Before the party could fully hoist Wolfgang back to safety, the creatures struck, dragging him into the void below as above the rope grew slack. His screams vanished into the endless dark, swallowed by the pit below.
  </p>

  <p>
    The survivors fled the amphitheater, the sound of those accursed chants chasing them back from the vomitorium. Fleeing across town, the city's decay became undeniable. It's denizens were malnourished, barely surviving. Many were completely blind, their eye sockets filled with raisin like growths. Something was feeding off these people, keeping them weak here trapped far below the earth. And then, as if summoned by the party's terror, that creature came again. As they stepped out of an alleyway, scuttling in silence to the left that elephant-sized grotesque egg creature scuttled through the town. Egg shaped and grotesque, scuttling forth on dozens of spindly legs, it's slick probusci glistening with malice, the same creature that had previously tried to attack Willy.
  </p>

  <p>
    Lomba, Alida, Patrick, and Scrooge fell victim to it's attack. It latched onto their faces in a foul hunger, and applying a tremendous pressure, sucked an eyeball from their sockets with a wet pop.  A proboscis sucked onto one of their eyeballs, and with a tremendous pressure the eyeball was sucked out of the socket and into the creature. The survivors returned back through the alleyway, as the creature continued on it's way, hunting for further victims.
  </p>

  <p>
    A bovine-faced man knelt nearby, kneeled down as if willingly having given it's eye to the beast. He spoke of the teachings of the priests of Yuzz that guided this town, that the Caretaker demands eyes as sacrifice, which the townsfolk willingly give. The pain of the sacrifice teaches them humility. Seeing the injured members of the party, the man guided the party to the Great Fungal Mound, who consumption seemed to be a ritual communion after making sacrifices to the Caretaker. The injured party members consumed from the mound, but managed to resist it's addiction.
  </p>

  <p>
    It was then that Pukk-Dudd found the party. With quiet gestures and low-spoken words, they made it clear to Haydee that they wanted the party to follow them, their eyes darting in shadows as if they feared discovery. The party followed Pukk-Dudd trough the fringes of the city, to a chamber below the glow worm farmers on the west side of the city. Within the stone chamber, behind a hidden curtain, they met Glor-Mug, a woman, almost human, but for lion-like legs and a lion-like tail trailing out from beneath her dress. She smiled at the party, and gestured to the other stones in the cell, which could serves as crude chairs. "I thank you for coming", she spoke, softly. "I mean you no harm, but I beg of you for our help".
  </p>

  <p>
    "Long ago, our ancestors were human, many generations ago, until we were changed by Lords of Chaos. Our ancestors escaped that bondage, and found solace within the ruins of this city. We found religion, worshipping and rituals of the priests of Yuzz and consuming of the Great Fungal Mound. The pain of sacrifice was meant to teach humility, and consumption from the Great Fungal Mound a communion, whose narcotic properties are an echo of the ecstasy found beyond death -- it's great mystery allows flesh to be restored, so that the great cycle of sacrifice might be maintained. But we traded one form of bondage for another. Here we are slaves to that great mound which sustains us, and in turn our eyes are used for evil. I used to be a believer, willingly giving my eyes to the Caretaker, and consuming from the Fungal Mind, which restores our eyes and maintains the malevolent cycle. I had dreams -- my eyes calling out to me. They are taken by the Caretaker to the Temple of Yuzz, and dwell there for some time until they are lost. I do not know the true nature of the evil preying upon us, but I feel it in my bones that it dwells in that temple. Too few believe the temple is our foe, and too many believe it is the road to salvation. Our civilization is dying. You, as outsiders, have a chance to free us from this curse. I have seen it in my dreams. Whether you succeed or not, I cannot say, but you must try. I beg of you."
  </p>

  <p>
    The party resolved to face the city's evils. They returned to the fungal mound and dragged Willy from the mound's narcotic grip. Together, they sought shelter in a derelict cell, and attempted to recuperate Willy, with both kindness and urgency. Steeling their courage, the party prepared for the descent into the unspeakable horrors of the Temple of Yuzz.
