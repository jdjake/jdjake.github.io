  <h4> <b> Part 1: The Call of the Empty Star </b> </h4>

  <p>
    The party were a gang of childhood friends, young peasants coming of age in the town of Boaring. From the moment they were strong enough to plow a field or ply the family trade, their life had been hard toil, sweating hard and covered in grime. The winters were no kinder, shivering under threadbare hides when winter came. Deep down, they knew this life wasn't for them.
  </p>

  <p>
    This year's harvest was hard like the rest, but this year's exertions weighed heavily upon the venerable shoulders of Old Man Roberts, an elder in the village, who'd taken a fondness to the group in their youth. He shared his meager rations with the gang when the cruel hand of famine stalked the land. And on nights when the group had gotten up to trouble -- letting lifestock loose, or sneaking off into the woods -- he'd spun stories to tell their parents and soften their punishment.
  </p>

  <p>
    Now the gang gathered at his bedside, near-adults rather than mischievous youths, as the end approached Old Roberts. A pall of age lay thick upon him, and the hoarfrost of death crept near. His breath shallow and slow, he told them a story from his youth a half century ago. A tale of constellations in the sky -- an 'Empty Star', a small ring of light in the sky he once saw as a young lad fifty winters past. Under the light of that strange star, a portal had opened by the old stone mounds that stood on the hills standing over the village.
  </p>

  <p>
    "I saw jewels there", he whispered. "Fine steel and enameled armor forged in the fires of some forgotten age. But I ran when the iron men attacked. I never saw the portal and that empty star again. I had a chance at a new life — a wondrous life of adventure — and I let my cowardice steal it from beneath my fingers".
  </p>

  <p>
    The group listened in silence, their thoughts turning from the old man’s fading words to the fields and workshops that awaited them, the endless grind of the seasons stretching out before them like a prison.
  </p>

  <p>
    "Do not let fear prevent you from achieving your desires, as it did me!", he rasped, his voice frail but resolute. "The Empty Star rises once more, and a young man with heart and boldness could make claim to a life beyond his means... if only he took the chance".
  </p>

  <p>
    And so it was that Robert's resolve ignited the hearts of these youths. That very night, beneath the same starry sky Roberts had described, they gathered what meager supplies they could find — old village tools that might serve them on the journey ahead — and met beneath the ancient stone mounds. Three standing stones leaned against one another, forming a window which framed the Empty Star. As the star reached it's peak, it's light seemed to catch between the stones, and a corridor lined with cold stone appeared beyond the threshold.
  </p>

  <p>
    With their hearts pounding, their grip tightening around their makeshift weapons, they stepped through the portal, leaving behind their quiet village and the fields and venturing into the unknown, thoughts of jewels and scorching wheat fields foremost in their minds.
  </p>




  <h4> <b> Part 2: The Star Door </b> </h4>

  <p>
    The adventurers pressed forward into a narrow passage, forcing them into single file, their timid whispers echoing off the cold stone walls. The starlight behind them poured through the portal, coming to an end at the foot of a stout, iron-banded door inscribed with an arrangement of jewels, set into strange, but deliberate, patterns.
  </p>

  <p>
    One of the more sharp-eyed of the group - perhaps Bobbi or Robbi Hobbington -- noticed the door reminded them of constellations of stars. His brother, leaning close to inspect the door, confirmed it. Yet the door gave no sign of an inner mechanism with which to adjust these jewels into a position that might cause the door to give way.
  </p>

  <p>
    The group sat confused and dejected by the door for some time, while Flocki the Dwarven herder grew restless, and returned back to the hilltop, seeking solace in the open air. As he stood once more beneath the cold light of the Empty star, his eyes wandered, glancing between the darkened sky, and the jewels on the other side of the portal. It was then he noticed that the jewels upon the door were *almost*, but not quite, aligned with the stars above. The Empty Star was adrift, hanging just shy of it's corresponding mark of the door.
  </p>

  <p>
    With this discovery in mind, Flocki returned to the group, sharing his observation. Though it was little comfort, it brought them a sliver of hope: perhaps the door’s secret was tied to the movement of the stars themselves.
  </p>

  <p>
    Over the next hour, the Empty Star slowly creeping closer to its designated place. Meanwhile, caution and fear gnawed at some in the party. What if the portal, once crossed, sealed behind them forever? To safeguard against such a fate, they lashed a chain to a wooden pole, driving it deep into the earth just outside the portal’s boundary. With the other end tied to the other side of the portal, they hoped the chain might tether the world they knew and the hallway inside, perhaps prolonging the connection that linked the two realities together.
  </p>

  <p>
    And then at last, the stars aligned. The Empty Star slipped into place, matching its crystal twin upon the door. With a deep, resonant creak, the door opened before them, revealing a darkness beyond.
  </p>



  <h4> <b> Part 3: The Iron Guardians And The Trap Of Spears </b> </h4>

  <p>
    Through the door, the party found themselves staring into a new chamber. Another door awaited them at the far end, flanked by four grim iron statues. Each was crafted in the likeness of a warrior, in a round iron helmet and thick scaled armor. In their hands, long spears were poised, ready to be hurled, each aimed at the doorway through which the party now peered.
  </p>

  <p>
    A heavy silence hung in the air as the group hesitated, unsure of what to make of these guardians. The statues seemed lifeless, yet their precision, their readiness, hinted at danger. The adventurers debated their next move, voices low and cautious. Flocki, ever the pragmatist, suggested testing the room’s safety with his beloved sow. After a brief, reluctant nod of agreement, the stout dwarf coaxed the nervous animal into the chamber.
  </p>

  <p>
    The sow entered, its hooves clattering on the cold stone floor, but the statues remained still. No trap was sprung, and for a moment, the group breathed easier. Encouraged by this, two of the party — TODO — stepped cautiously into the room. But with a sudden, terrible movement, the statues came to life. Four spears flew through the air with lightning speed. Two of them hurtled toward Flocki's sow, who squealed and darted out of the way. Two more went for the peasants. TODO, quick on his feet, managed to dive out of the way, but TODO was not so fortunate.  The spear found its mark, burying deep in TODO's side, a fatal wound. He gasped and fell, his lifeblood pooling on the stone floor. The other two spears went for Flocki's sow, who squealed and darted out of the way.
  </p>

  <p>
    The statues, their duty fulfilled, froze once more, locked in place with their arms still outstretched, now empty of their deadly weapons. Having flung their spears, the statues remained locked in a post-throw position. The group approached the statues. Close up, the statues looked human, except there was something uncanny about them the group couldn't put their finger on. Scavenging the spears that had survived being thrown, and taking the armor from the statues, the group passed through the door into the next room.
  </p>


  <h4> <b> Part 4: The Monument Hall </b> </h4>

  <p>
    The party entered a wide, spacious rectangular chamber of polished marble, with a door on each wall. Their eyes were immediately drawn to the far end, for in front of them stood a towering granite statue of a muscular savage, clad in animal hide, with intelligent eyes and a neck draped in amulets and charms. A grimoire hung beside a broadsword on the hip. One of the statue's arms extended outwards, pointing an accusatory finger at the party.
  </p>

  <p>
    Like with the statues of the previous room, there was something unnerving about the statue. After a few moments, they realized what was off: the figure’s proportions were distorted. The limbs were too thick, the body too short, and the beetled brows jutted out far more than usual, casting deep shadows across the statue's face. These statues were of humans of a different kind, perhaps of a distant age or place.
  </p>

  <p>
    Conan the Hunter, ever the boldest, was the first to step into the room. He turned away from the statue to survey the chamber, and noticed a series of fine scorch marks marring the otherwise pristine marble, as if campfires had been started in the room.
  </p>

  <p>
    As he studied the floor, the statue stirred. With a deep, resonant sound, the statue began to swivel, the pointing finger tracking Conan's movement through the room.
  </p>

  <p>
    The others cautiously entered the room, but the statue seemed uninterested in them, its attention solely focused on Conan. They huddled near the statue’s base, uncertain of its intent, while Conan approached the door on the right-hand wall. Ever wary of traps, he stood to the side of the door before nudging it open.
  </p>

  <p>
    It was at this point the statue activated, sending forth a scorching burst of flame from it's fingertip. Conan tried to dodge, but the statue followed his movement, and the flames quickly engulfed him. His agonized cries echoed briefly in the chamber before being snuffed out, leaving behind only a charred, smoldering form.
  </p>

  <p>
    TODO tried to save Conan's body by dragging his remains out of the fire. But it was too late. For a minute the flames continued, threatening to turn the room into an over. But eventually the flames began to sputter and subside, leaving behind the acrid stench of fuel and burnt flesh. With no other option but to press on, the group salvaged what they could from Conan's charred corpse, and pressed on.
  </p>



  <h4> <b> Part 4: The Guardian Serpent And The Shrouded Alcoves </b> </h4>

  <p>
    A musty air greeted the group as they opened the right-most door, the scent of decay and forgotten time. Seven alcoves lined the walls of the room ahead of them, each raised and draped with shrouds that obsucred what lay within. Tentatively, the group took several cautious steps into the room, but were greeted by a rattling and clacking that came from each of the alcoves. Fear quickly overtoook them. The group scrambled back through the door, sealed it shut, and turned to the left-most door hoping for better fortune.
  </p>

  <p>
    Beyond this door lay another turning corridor, ending into an entrance of a grand chamber dominated by a wide, imposingg stone throne. The walls were adroend with long clay tablets, suspended from above, covered in strange symbols and pictograms that none from the party could recognize. The air was thick with a sense of ancient power, and though the chamber appeared empty, they knew it concealed something more.
  </p>

  <p>
    One brave member of the group (TODO: Which of Alex's Peasants) stepped into the room. From behind the throne, an enormous sepent slithered from it's hiding place behind thr throne. Its scaaled gleamed with bands of crimson that flickered like hellfire, and a singular demonic horn jutted from the center of its head. It's eyes glowed with malice, and it spoke in a low, sibulant hiss that reverberated through the room: "I am Ssissuraaagg, and you intrude on my guardiansssship." Then, with terrifying speed, the serpent lunged forward, its fangs bared.
  </p>

  <p>
    Fortunately, TODO was fast. He darted back towards the door, slamming it shut just in time to block the serpent's deadly strike. The group hurried to secure the door - wedging one of the spears they'd scavenged earlier to creeate a temporary barricade to keep Ssissuraagg at bay.
  </p>

  <p>
    As the serpent repeated pounded against the door, it's fury evident, the group wasted no time fleeing back through the corridor, hoping to lose the guardian snake.
  </p>



  <h4> <b> Part 5: The Crystal Men </b> </h4>

  <p>
    Hoping to lose Ssissuraagg, the group bolted back to the pointing savage. Wasting no time, they pushed through the last door they had yet to explore, on the north side. They found themselves amid an oddly tranquil scene. A vast hall stretched ahead, with a large rectangular pool of water running down it's center, with tall columns looming over either side. Diffuse light radiated upwards from the bottom of the pool, casting a pale, otherwordly light on the pillars above.
  </p>

  <p>
    From behind the pillars, man-sized crystallize beings emerged from the shadows, slowly but deliberately shuffling towards the party, their bodies sparkling like jewels as they caught on the light from the pool. Sensing a trap, the group exchanged quick, nervous glances. It was clear that the crystal men, while slow, could prove a tough foe if attacked. So they crept around the edges of the room, hugging the walls and keeping a wide berth from the crystalline beings. As they traverse the room, something caught their attention; the floor of the pool was encrusted with jewels, each glimmering in the light below, reminding them of the constellations on the entrance door, though not matching any of the sky they knew. Moving fast the avoid Ssissuraag, the group took note of the jewels, but continued onwards.
  </p>



  <h4> <b> Part 6: March of the Clay Troop </b> </h4>

  <p>
    What awaited them next took their breath away. They stepped into an enormous, three-tiered chamber that sprawled out before them. At the far end of the room, upon a raised dais, sat an oversized throne. And upon that throne, in regal stillness, sat a clay warlord. Its grim features, with the same exaggerated proportions as the savage statue from earlier, gazed over the room with a stony, imperious air. Above the warlord, a pulsating light emanated from a crystal globe, casting a ghostly glow over the scene.
  </p>

  <p>
    At the end of the hall, the party came upon a doorway that lead to a descending spiral staircase, which lead to a long, narrow chamber lined with ledges on either side. Each ledge held miniature clay soldiers in neat rows. And in the center of the room, two large tables with strange topography faced one another, with hills and valley populated by small armies of clay figurines, and buildings with an alien, unfamiliar architecture. Four of the soldiers were made of silver, standing atop the hills of each table watching the other soldiers from below. The group stashed those soldiers in their bags, and pressed onwards.
  </p>

  <p>
    In the next room, the party was met with a breathtaking scene. An enormous, three-tiered chambed spread before the group. An oversized throne rested upon a raised dais at the far end of the room. Seated on the dias was a clay warlord upon an oversized throne, bearing a resemblance to the pointing statue from the level above. Above the warlord, a pulsating light emanated from a crystal globe.
  </p>

  <p>
    Below the dais, seven statues stood in rigid silence, standing above a lowered pit that stretched the length of the chamber. In the pit stood an army of human sized clay soldiers in marching formation, their clay armor and clay spears equipped for war. 
  </p>

  <p>
    For a moment, the party hesitated, overwhelmed by the sheer scale of what lay before them But the moment was broken when the clay warlord jerkily raised it's arm, pointing at the group. The army below responded by taking a lurching step forward. The sound of their collective feet echoed like thunder through the chamber.
  </p>

  <p>
    In a temporary panic, the grouup fled to the opposite room. Desparately, they studied the clay models with the hope they might contain a clue to the vast army before them. But the models offered no answers, and the rumbling of marching feet grew louder and louder. Seeing no other option, the party steeled themselves, and reentered the Warlord's chamber.
  </p>

  <p>
    The frontline warriors had reached the alcove the party stood upon, and began to clamber jerkily up towards them. The situation seemed hopeless, until those with the finest aim took up spears. With fine aim (and a healthy dose of luck), three spears flew across the chamber, striking true in the heart of the warlord at the other end of the chamber, and with a resounding crack, the warlord's clay form shattered into pieces. Just as the frontlines were about to strike, they lost their anima, returning again to lifelessness.
  </p>



<h4><b> Part 7: A Treasure Trove </b> </h4>

<p>
  Timidly, the party wove their way between the now-lifeless clay soldiers. With a mix of trepidation and determination, they ascended the dais to the throne of the clay warlord. TODO snatched the crystal globe from atop the warlord's throne. The globe continued to shine an eerie glow, casting shifting shadows between the clay men as TODO held it aloft.
</p>

<p>
  Without a final treasure trove, the party began turned their attention skeptically to the far end of the chamber, where the wall seemed to be a dead end. They pored over the clay bricks for signs of a hidden passage. Their persistence paid off when they discovered that twisting the ornate arm of the throne activated a concealed mechanism, causing the bricks of the far wall to shift, stretching back to unveil a narrow dark hallway.
</p>

<p>
  At the end of this long hallway, the party was met with a spartanly appointed room, with simple wooden shelves and a modest sleeping pallet. On the shelves, the group found a bronze rod engraved with half of a demon's face, a finely crafted copper brazier, an assortment of weapons, a suit of shining scale mail, and a large tome written in incomprehensible script. In the center of the floor, on a wide stone table upon which a large pentacle was engraved in chalk, a wrinkled ancient body lay, with a stone bowl above it's head.
</p>

<p>
  Aside from Bobbi Hobbington, who egged his brother on to mess with the body -- perhaps with the hope of becoming the sole heir of the Hobbington dyeing business -- the group decided not to risk entering the pentacle. They'd secured enough treasure to ensure a lasting fortune, and decided to make their escape before the portal back to their reality closed forever.
</p>

<p>
  But as the group returned from the hallway, they were met with a dire sight. Ssissuraag had finally tracked them down, standing tall atop th warlord's throne, eyes glowing with fury, with fangs bared and ready to lunge.
</p>

<p>
  A fierce battle ensured. Using their newly found weapons, the party eventually managed to inflict a fatal wound upon the serpent, while only sustaining a few cuts and bruises themselves. In its final moments, Ssissuraag's massive form began to retract in on itself, until all that remained with it's single demonic horn. TODO picked up the weapon - as they did, a faint whisper seemed to echo from the horn: "Finally freeeee"...
</p>


<h4> <b> Part 8: Returning Home </b> </h4>

<p>
  Sensing time was perilously short, the group hurriedly made their way back to the tomb's entrance. As they dashed through the entrance corridor, they heard the cry of roosters from the rising dawn in front of them - a reminder of the normalcy they'd left behind only hours before. As they burst through the portal, the first light of dawn struck their faces, bathing Boaring town in a warm, golden glow. The portal behind them shimmered, and then faded from view, until only the old weathered stones on the other side of the circle could be seen between the standing stones they'd exited from
</p>

<p>
  In a delirious rush, the party raced through the waking streets of Boaring back to Old Man Robert's house, villagers turning to look at the strange youths. The scene was somber as they arrived, mournful relatives and friends crowded around. Ignoring the tears and confusing, the party pushed their way into the bedroom, reaching Old Robert's bedside just as he was drawing his final breaths.
</p>

<p>
  As the dying man's gaze full upon the group, clad in blood-soaked armor and bearing glittering treasures from their adventure, a glimmer of youthful excitement sparked in his weary eyes. With surprising vigor, Roberts leapt from his bed, embracing the youths with delight using what last strength he had. In that brief electrifying moment, Robert experienced a taste of the victory and adventure he'd long longed for.
</p>

<p>
  Then, with a final sigh of contentment washing over him, Robert closed his eyes, his life slipping away as peacefully as a setting sun. The party gently laid his body back onto the bed, standing in silent respect around the man who had once dreamed of the very triumphs they now lived. They'd honored Roberts’ memory by securing their own place in the annals of adventure.
</p>
