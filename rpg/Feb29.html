    <h1> Peril at Palmfish Bay </h1>

  <h4> <b> Date: </b> February 29th, 2024 </h4>
  <h4> <b> Players: </b> Abe, Dan, Hugh </h4>

  <br>

  <div>

  <h4> <b> Characters </b> </h4>
  <p>
    Abe played <em>Bep 'Gunpowder' Glover</em>, a Jesuit Monk based on the isle of Yuma. Known for his stench, the rotten teeth hanging out of his mouth, and his preference for alchohol.
  </p>
  <p>
    Dan played <em>Iago ‘Le Red Bird’</em>, a backstabbing rapscallion, a sailor with an insatiable urge for treasure. His previous adventures lead him to a narrow escape from a cannibalistic ending, but he never escaped <em>that smell</em>.
  </p>
  <p>
    Hugh played <em> Low Roller </em>, a swashbuckler who concealed a mysterious past as a barkeep with a liking for mocking banter amongst the other crewmates. There was <em>something contagious</em> about him.
  </p>
  <p>
    Hugh also played <em>Eva 'Two Toes' Martinez</em>, a Rotund wig-wearing Buccaneer. Marooned after a failed mutinee aboard the Portugeuse navy, Eva picked himself up and had been running some odd jobs to make a name for himself in the free ports of the Carribean.
  </p>

  <h4> <b> Peril at Palmfish Bay </b> </h4>

  <p>
    The party headed into the bush, leaving a thin trail of tar to guide them back to where they'd been if they happened to get lost. Abe had some navigational experience, and lead the way, guided by a thin beam of light that came down into the otherwise dark undergrowth. After about an hour's walking through the heavy, dewy foliage, they arrived at Palmfish Bay, the small fishing village on the isle of Yuma.
  </p>

  <p>
    Normally filled with the cries of workers packing their catch into crates to ship off to the nearest free ports, Palmfish Bay was eerily silent. The first thing the gang noticed were the ramshackle wooden gallows in a yard, a short distance away from the largest huts in the village. Low Roller, Iago, and Eva went to check the gallows.
  </p>

  <p>
    Three corpses hung from above the gallows, looking down on them from hollow eye sockets as they approached. Gunpowder kept his distance, fearing he might recognize the corpses as one of his friends. The bodies were well rotted, having clearly been hung there for a crime committed in the weeks prior. But as they came closer, one of the corpses sprung to life, clawing at the trio from the noose. Standing well back, Eva, Iago, and Low Roller fired their the head's of the hanged, hoping that would prevent them from coming back to life to harm them.
  </p>

  <p>
    Ironically, the loud gunshots awoke some more of the living dead. Three zombies took leave of some of the houses in the town. One moved faster than the others, with long gnarled fingernails. Another moved slower more slowly, with a bulging pulsating stomach. As it moved closer, it became apparent that thse pulsations were the result of some creatures writhing inside. The trio took pot shots at the approaching zombies from the top of the gallows, missing the crucial shots which might have impeded the zombies progress. They were thus forced to confront the two faster zombies, the slower, larger zombie looming behind them.
  </p>

  <p>
    One zombie clawed at Low Roller, tearing his shirt and digging long claws into his chest. The three responded by slicing up the two zombies, but by the time they'd taken these two out, the larger zombie had reached them. Low Roller and Iago tried slicing the larger zombie's stomach. Perhaps weakening the midriff, Eva took aim with their musket and punctured a large hole in the stomach. The resulting pressure caused the stomach to completely rupture, and a foul smelling, maggot-filled putresence erupted from the zombies stomach. The three managed to duck, only being specked with a few globules from the blast. Perhaps feeling the hunger from it's stomach being emptied, the zombie tried to take a bite out of Low Roller, but he managed to dodge out the way. A few slices later, and this third zombie was down.
  </p>

  <p>
    In the meantime, Gunpowder had taken off from the group, and decided to see if he could scavenge some supplies from the surrounding village, hoping to find the best supplies in the Chief Councilor's hut. Sneaking past two zombies disemboweling a lavishly attired corpse, Gunpowder went into the kitchen. Inside, he found some recently rancid fish, three bottles of rum and a packet of matches. He put what he could in his bucket, and snuck back outside.
  </p>

  <p>
    Across from the Counciler's hut, emerging from the corner of a small, dilapilated hut, stood a hollowed eyed girl in a blue dress, a weather-worn toy bear hanging slack from her left hand. Gunpowder recognized the girl - one of the very few of the town who had accepted him. In an attempt to perhaps save the girl, Bep tried to channel whatever holy powers he. He emptied his bucket of booze onto the floor, filled it with a nearby barrel of rainwater, trying to find some holy connection with which to bless the rainwater. A small splash seemed to have an effect, so he emptied his bucket onto the girl, while chanting consecrated words.
  </p>

  <p>
    The girl quaked as if some inner battle raged inside her, and then dropped, lifeless, to the ground. Gunpowder concluded these bodies were reanimated corpses, their souls having left their body long before the group of pirates arrived at the village.
  </p>

  <p>
    Reuniting with the rest of the party, the group searched a small shack to see if they could find anything else of use before they left the village. Searching through some refuse there proved profitable - they managed to scrounge together some medical supplies, a lantern, and a bag of Okra seed.
  </p>

  <p>
    Outside of the shack, the noise of the group's rummaging had attracted the noise of another three zombies. They hadn't precisely located the group, but were sniffing the air, searching for them. The group decided this was their time to sneak out of the town. Hugh tried to lead the party out of the town, but was foiled by stumbling over the threshold of the shack as they left. The zombies started to stumble towards them, and they were forced to bolt into the bush to get away.
  </p>

  <p>
    Disoriented from the escape, the group stumbled through the undergrowth, pushing through the large fronds and palms. They quickly became lost in the undergrowth. Checking. Making a headcount, they realized that in the adrenaline of the fight, at some point Annemicke had gotten separated from the group. Before they had time to recollect where he could have gotten lost, they heard talking coming out of a clearing emerging before them. They tried to keep closer, but made too loud a rustling noise through the branches and leaves. Whoever the voices were knew they were coming...
