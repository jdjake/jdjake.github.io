    <h1> Exploring Port Fortune </h1>

  <h4> <b> Date: </b> May 15th, 2024 </h4>
  <h4> <b> Players: </b> Avi, Abe, Dan, Gary </h4>

  <br>

  <div>

  <h4> <b> Characters </b> </h4>
  <p>
    Avi played ?
  </p>
  <p>
    Abe played <em>Bep 'Gunpowder' Glover</em>, a Jesuit Monk based on the isle of Yuma. Known for his stench, the rotten teeth hanging out of his mouth, and his preference for alchohol.
  </p>
  <p>
    Dan played <em>Iago ‘Le Red Bird’</em>, a backstabbing rapscallion, a sailor with an insatiable urge for treasure. His previous adventures lead him to a narrow escape from a cannibalistic ending, but he never escaped <em>that smell</em>.
  </p>
  <p>
    Gary played <em>Annemicke 'Flatline' Hollegate</em>, a known pirate and heretic amongst the colonial powers of the Caribbean. He'd gained a knack for wilderness survival, even if it'd cost him his right eye in the process.
  </p>

  <h4> <b> BLAH </b> </h4>

  <ul>
    <li> Xoth’s still on your ship. You met Nerith, who was captured by some pirates. She warned you about some growing darkness gathering in the middle of the map. You released her back into the ocean. </li>
    <li> You spent the night drinking at the Sultry Siren. You awoke to find some of your items missing. You travelled around town looking for your stuff. </li>
    <li> You talked to some sailors aboard the Jade Rebellion, who were heading out from Port Fortune. You talked to Armando, the proprietor of the Curio Emporium, who you bribed to let you know if any items of sentimental value crossed his palms. Then you went to Whitmore House, where the Matron of the house, Esmeralda Snow, traded you information about where your items could have gone in exchange for some money. You also made a trade of information with her in exchange for information about where the cultists of the sunken one could have gone. </li>
  </ul>
